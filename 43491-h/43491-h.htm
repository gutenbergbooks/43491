  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Smithsonian Institution,</span><br/><span class="sc">Bureau of American Ethnology,</span><br/><i>Washington, D. C., January 7, 1914.</i></p>

  <p>Sir: I have the honor to submit the accompanying manuscript of a
  memoir bearing the title "An Introduction to the Study of the Maya
  Hieroglyphs," by Sylvanus Griswold Morley, and to recommend its
  publication as a bulletin of the Bureau of American Ethnology.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphic writing developed by the Maya of Central America and
  southern Mexico was probably the foremost intellectual achievement of
  pre-Columbian times in the New World, and as such it deserves equal
  attention with other graphic systems of antiquity.</p>

  <p>The earliest inscriptions now extant probably date from about the
  beginning of the Christian era, but such is the complexity of the glyphs
  and subject matter even at this early period, that in order to estimate
  the age of the system it is necessary to postulate a far greater
  antiquity for its origin. Indeed all that can be accepted safely in this
  direction is that many centuries must have elapsed before the Maya
  hieroglyphic writing could have been developed to the highly complex
  stage where we first encounter it.</p>

  <p>The first student to make any progress in deciphering the Maya
  inscriptions was Prof. Ernst Förstemann, of the Royal Library at Dresden.
  About 1880 Professor Förstemann published a facsimile reproduction of the
  Dresden codex, and for the next twenty years devoted the greater part of
  his time to the elucidation of this manuscript. He it was who first
  discovered and worked out the ingenious vigesimal system of numeration
  used by the Maya, and who first pointed out how this system was utilized
  to record astronomical and chronological facts. In short, his pioneer
  work made possible all subsequent progress in deciphering Maya texts.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, about the same time, or a little later (in 1891),
  another student of the same subject, Mr. J. T. Goodman, of Alameda,
  California, working independently and without knowledge of Professor
  Förstemann's researches, also succeeded in deciphering the chronological
  parts of the Maya texts, and in determining the values of the
  head-variant numerals. Mr. Goodman also perfected some <!-- Page iv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv"></a>{iv}</span>tables, "The
  Archaic Chronological Calendar" and "The Archaic Annual Calendar," which
  greatly facilitate the decipherment of the calculations recorded in the
  texts.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that very little progress has been made in
  deciphering the Maya glyphs except those relating to the calendar and
  chronology; that is, the signs for the various time periods (days and
  months), the numerals, and a few name-glyphs; however, as these known
  signs comprise possibly two-fifths of all the glyphs, it is clear that
  the general tenor of the Maya inscriptions is no longer concealed from
  us. The remaining three-fifths probably tell the nature of the events
  which occurred on the corresponding dates, and it is to these we must
  turn for the subject matter of Maya history. The deciphering of this
  textual residuum is enormously complicated by the character of the Maya
  glyphs, which for the greater part are ideographic rather than phonetic;
  that is, the various symbols represent ideas rather than sounds.</p>

  <p>In a graphic system composed largely of ideographic elements it is
  extremely difficult to determine the meanings of the different signs,
  since little or no help is to be derived from varying combinations of
  elements as in a phonetic system. In phonetic writing the symbols have
  fixed sounds, which are unchanging throughout, and when these values have
  once been determined, they may be substituted for the characters wherever
  they occur, and thus words are formed.</p>

  <p>While the Maya glyphs largely represent ideas, indubitable traces of
  phoneticism and phonetic composition appear. There are perhaps half a
  dozen glyphs in all which are known to be constructed on a purely
  phonetic basis, and as the remaining glyphs are gradually deciphered this
  number will doubtless be increased.</p>

  <p>The progress which has been made in deciphering the Maya inscriptions
  may be summarized as follows: The Maya calendar, chronology, and
  astronomy as recorded in the hieroglyphic texts have been carefully
  worked out, and it is unlikely that future discoveries will change our
  present conception of them. There remains, however, a group of glyphs
  which are probably non-calendric, non-chronologic, and non-astronomic in
  character. These, it may be reasonably expected, will be found to
  describe the subject matter of Maya history; that is, they probably set
  forth the nature of the events which took place on the dates recorded. An
  analogy would be the following: Supposing, in scanning a history of the
  United States, only the dates could be read. We would find, for example,
  July 4, 1776, followed by unknown characters; April 12, 1861, by others;
  and March 4, 1912, by others. This, then, is the case with the Maya
  glyphs&mdash;we find dates followed by glyphs of unknown meaning, which
  presumably set forth the nature of the corresponding events. In a word,
  we know now the <!-- Page v --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagev"></a>{v}</span>chronologic skeleton of Maya history; it
  remains to work out the more intimate details which alone can make it a
  vital force.</p>

  <p>The published writings on the subject of the Maya hieroglyphs have
  become so voluminous, and are so widely scattered and inaccessible, that
  it is difficult for students of Central American archeology to become
  familiar with what has been accomplished in this important field of
  investigation. In the present memoir Mr. Morley, who has devoted a number
  of years to the study of Maya archeology, and especially to the
  hieroglyphs, summarizes the results of these researches to the present
  time, and it is believed that this <i>Introduction to the Study of the
  Maya Hieroglyphs</i> will be the means of enabling ready and closer
  acquaintance with this interesting though intricate subject.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">PREFACE</p>

  <p>With the great expansion of interest in American archeology during the
  last few years there has grown to be a corresponding need and demand for
  primary textbooks, archeological primers so to speak, which will enable
  the general reader, without previous knowledge of the science, to
  understand its several branches. With this end in view, the author has
  prepared An Introduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>The need for such a textbook in this particular field is suggested by
  two considerations: (1) The writings of previous investigators, having
  been designed to meet the needs of the specialist rather than those of
  the beginner, are for the greater part too advanced and technical for
  general comprehension; and (2) these writings are scattered through many
  publications, periodicals as well as books, some in foreign languages,
  and almost all difficult of access to the average reader.</p>

  <p>To the second of these considerations, however, the writings of Mr. C.
  P. Bowditch, of Boston, Massachusetts, offer a conspicuous exception,
  particularly his final contribution to this subject, entitled "The
  Numeration, Calendar Systems, and Astronomical Knowledge of the Mayas,"
  the publication of which in 1910 marked the dawn of a new era in the
  study of the Maya hieroglyphic writing. In this work Mr. Bowditch
  exhaustively summarizes all previous knowledge of the subject, and also
  indicates the most promising lines for future investigation. The book is
  a vast storehouse of heretofore scattered material, now gathered together
  for the first time and presented to the student in a readily accessible
  form. Indeed, so thorough is its treatment, the result of many years of
  intensive study, that the writer would have hesitated to bring out
  another work, necessarily covering much of the same ground, had it not
  been for his belief that Mr. Bowditch's book is too advanced for lay
  comprehension. The Maya hieroglyphic writing is exceedingly intricate;
  its subject matter is complex and its forms irregular; and in order to be
  understood it must be presented in a very elementary way. The writer
  believes that this primer method of treatment has not been followed in
  the publication in question and, furthermore, that the omission of
  specimen texts, which would give the student practice in deciphering the
  glyphs, renders it too technical for use by the beginner. <!-- Page viii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span></p>

  <p>Acknowledgment should be made here to Mr. Bowditch for his courtesy in
  permitting the reproduction of a number of drawings from his book, the
  examples of the period, day and month glyphs figured being derived almost
  entirely from this source; and in a larger sense for his share in the
  establishment of instruction in this field of research at Harvard
  University where the writer first took up these studies.</p>

  <p>In the limited space available it would have been impossible to
  present a detailed picture of the Maya civilization, nor indeed is this
  essential to the purpose of the book. It has been thought advisable,
  however, to precede the general discussion of the hieroglyphs with a
  brief review of the habitat, history, customs, government, and religion
  of the ancient Maya, so that the reader may gather a general idea of the
  remarkable people whose writing and calendar he is about to study.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Habitat</span></p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, the Maya were a lowland people, inhabiting the
  Atlantic coast plains of southern Mexico and northern Central America.
  (See pl. <a href="#plate1">1</a>.) The southern part of this region is
  abundantly watered by a network of streams, many of which have their rise
  in the Cordillera, while the northern part, comprising the peninsula of
  Yucatan, is entirely lacking in water courses and, were it not for
  natural wells (<i>cenotes</i>) here and there, would be uninhabitable.
  This condition in the north is due to the geologic formation of the
  peninsula, a vast plain underlaid by limestone through which water
  quickly percolates to subterranean channels.</p>

  <p>In the south the country is densely forested, though occasional
  savannas break the monotony of the tropical jungles. The rolling surface
  is traversed in places by ranges of hills, the most important of which
  are the Cockscomb Mountains of British Honduras; these attain an
  elevation of 3,700 feet. In Yucatan the nature of the soil and the
  water-supply not being favorable to the growth of a luxuriant vegetation,
  this region is covered with a smaller forest growth and a sparser bush
  than the area farther southward.</p>

  <p>The climate of the region occupied by the Maya is tropical; there are
  two seasons, the rainy and the dry. The former lasts from May or June
  until January or February, there being considerable local variation not
  only in the length of this season but also in the time of its
  beginning.</p>

  <p>Deer, tapirs, peccaries, jaguars, and game of many other kinds abound
  throughout the entire region, and doubtless formed a large part of the
  food supply in ancient times, though formerly corn was the staple, as it
  is now.</p>

  <p>There are at present upward of twenty tribes speaking various dialects
  of the Maya language, perhaps half a million people in all. These live in
  the same general region their ancestors occupied, but under greatly
  changed conditions. Formerly the Maya were the van of civilization in the
  New World,<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but to-day they
  are a dwindling <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>race, their once remarkable civilization is a
  thing of the past, and its manners and customs are forgotten.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">History</span></p>

  <p>The ancient Maya, with whom this volume deals, emerged from barbarism
  probably during the first or second century of the Christian Era; at
  least their earliest dated monument can not be ascribed with safety to a
  more remote period.<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> How
  long a time had been required for the development of their complex
  calendar and hieroglyphic system to the point of graphic record, it is
  impossible to say, and any estimate can be only conjectural. It is
  certain, however, that a long interval must have elapsed from the first
  crude and unrelated scratches of savagery to the elaborate and involved
  hieroglyphs found on the earliest monuments, which represent not only the
  work of highly skilled sculptors, but also the thought of intensively
  developed minds. That this period was measured by centuries rather than
  by decades seems probable; the achievement was far too great to have been
  performed in a single generation or even in five or ten.</p>

  <p>It seems safe to assume, therefore, that by the end of the second
  century of the Christian Era the Maya civilization was fairly on its
  feet. There then began an extraordinary development all along the line.
  City after city sprang into prominence throughout the southern part of
  the Maya territory,<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> each
  contributing its share to the general progress and art of the time. With
  accomplishment came confidence and a quickening of pace. All activities
  doubtless shared in the general uplift which followed, though little more
  than the material evidences of architecture and sculpture have survived
  the ravages of the destructive environment in which this culture
  flourished; and it is chiefly from these remnants of ancient Maya art
  that the record of progress has been partially reconstructed.</p>

  <p>This period of development, which lasted upward of 400 years, or until
  about the close of the sixth century, may be called <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>perhaps the "Golden Age of
  the Maya"; at least it was the first great epoch in their history, and so
  far as sculpture is concerned, the one best comparable to the classic
  period of Greek art. While sculpture among the Maya never again reached
  so high a degree of perfection, architecture steadily developed, almost
  to the last. Judging from the dates inscribed upon their monuments, all
  the great cities of the south flourished during this period: Palenque and
  Yaxchilan in what is now southern Mexico; Piedras Negras, Seibal, Tikal,
  Naranjo, and Quirigua in the present Guatemala; and Copan in the present
  Honduras. All these cities rose to greatness and sank again into
  insignificance, if not indeed into oblivion, before the close of this
  Golden Age.</p>

  <p>The causes which led to the decline of civilization in the south are
  unknown. It has been conjectured that the Maya were driven from their
  southern homes by stronger peoples pushing in from farther south and from
  the west, or again, that the Maya civilization, having run its natural
  course, collapsed through sheer lack of inherent power to advance. Which,
  if either, of these hypotheses be true, matters little, since in any
  event one all-important fact remains: Just after the close of Cycle 9 of
  Maya chronology, toward the end of the sixth century, there is a sudden
  and final cessation of dates in all the southern cities, apparently
  indicating that they were abandoned about this time.</p>

  <p>Still another condition doubtless hastened the general decline if
  indeed it did no more. There is strong documentary evidence<a
  name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> that about the middle or
  close of the fifth century the southern part of Yucatan was discovered
  and colonized. In the century following, the southern cities one by one
  sank into decay; at least none of their monuments bear later dates, and
  coincidently Chichen Itza, the first great city of the north, was founded
  and rose to prominence. In the absence of reliable contemporaneous
  records it is impossible to establish the absolute accuracy of any theory
  relating to times so <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page4"></a>{4}</span>remote as those here under consideration; but
  it seems not improbable that after the discovery of Yucatan and the
  subsequent opening up of that vast region, the southern cities commenced
  to decline. As the new country waxed the old waned, so that by the end of
  the sixth century the rise of the one and the fall of the other had
  occurred.</p>

  <p>The occupation and colonization of Yucatan marked the dawn of a new
  era for the Maya although their Renaissance did not take place at once.
  Under pressure of the new environment, at best a parched and waterless
  land, the Maya civilization doubtless underwent important modification.<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The period of colonization,
  with the strenuous labor by which it was marked, was not conducive to
  progress in the arts. At first the struggle for bare existence must have
  absorbed in a large measure the energies of all, and not until their
  foothold was secure could much time have been available for the
  cultivation of the gentler pursuits. Then, too, at first there seems to
  have been a feeling of unrest in the new land, a shifting of homes and a
  testing of localities, all of which retarded the development of
  architecture, sculpture, and other arts. Bakhalal (see pl. <a
  href="#plate1">1</a>), the first settlement in the north, was occupied
  for only 60 years. Chichen Itza, the next location, although occupied for
  more than a century, was finally abandoned and the search for a new home
  resumed. Moving westward from Chichen Itza, Chakanputun was seized and
  occupied at the beginning of the eighth century. Here the Maya are said
  to have lived for 260 years, until the destruction of Chakanputun by fire
  about 960 A.&nbsp;D. again set them wandering. By this time, however, some
  four centuries had elapsed since the first colonization of the country,
  and they doubtless felt themselves fully competent to cope with any
  problems arising from their environment. Once more their energies had
  begun to find outlet in artistic expression. The Transitional Period was
  at an end, and The Maya Renaissance, if the term may be used, was fully
  under way.</p>

  <p>The opening of the eleventh century witnessed important and
  far-reaching political changes in Yucatan. After the destruction of
  Chakanputun the horizon of Maya activity expanded. Some of the fugitives
  from Chakanputun reoccupied Chichen Itza while others established
  themselves at a new site called Mayapan. About this time also the city of
  Uxmal seems to have been founded. In the year 1000 these three
  cities&mdash;Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Mayapan&mdash;formed a
  confederacy,<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> in which each
  was to share equally in the government of the country. Under the peaceful
  conditions which <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>followed the formation of this confederacy for
  the next 200 years the arts blossomed forth anew.</p>

  <p>This was the second and last great Maya epoch. It was their Age of
  Architecture as the first period had been their Age of Sculpture. As a
  separate art sculpture languished; but as an adjunct, an embellishment to
  architecture, it lived again. The one had become handmaiden to the other.
  Façades were treated with a sculptural decoration, which for intricacy
  and elaboration has rarely been equaled by any people at any time; and
  yet this result was accomplished without sacrifice of beauty or dignity.
  During this period probably there arose the many cities which to-day are
  crumbling in decay throughout the length and breadth of Yucatan, their
  very names forgotten. When these were in their prime, the country must
  have been one great beehive of activity, for only a large population
  could have left remains so extensive.</p>

  <p>This era of universal peace was abruptly terminated about 1200 A.&nbsp;D.
  by an event which shook the body politic to its foundations and disrupted
  the Triple Alliance under whose beneficent rule the land had grown so
  prosperous. The ruler of Chichen Itza, Chac Xib Chac, seems to have
  plotted against his colleague of Mayapan, one Hunnac Ceel, and in the
  disastrous war which followed, the latter, with the aid of Nahua
  allies,<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> utterly routed his
  opponent and drove him from his city. The conquest of Chichen Itza seems
  to have been followed during the thirteenth century by attempted
  reprisals on the part of the vanquished Itza, which plunged the country
  into civil war; and this struggle in turn paved the way for the final
  eclipse of Maya supremacy in the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>After the dissolution of the Triple Alliance a readjustment of power
  became necessary. It was only natural that the victors in the late war
  should assume the chief direction of affairs, and there is strong
  evidence that Mayapan became the most important city in the land. It is
  not improbable also that as a result of this war Chichen Itza was turned
  over to Hunnac Ceel's Nahua allies, perhaps in recognition of their
  timely assistance, or as their share in the spoils of war. It is certain
  that sometime during its history Chichen Itza came under a strong Nahua
  influence. One group of buildings in particular<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> shows in its architecture and bas-reliefs
  that it was undoubtedly inspired by Nahua rather than by Maya ideals.</p>

  <p>According to Spanish historians, the fourteenth century was
  characterized by increasing arrogance and oppression on the part of the
  rulers of Mayapan, who found it necessary to surround themselves with
  Nahua allies in order to keep the rising discontent of their <!-- Page 6
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>subjects in
  check.<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> This unrest finally
  reached its culmination about the middle of the fifteenth century, when
  the Maya nobility, unable longer to endure such tyranny, banded
  themselves together under the leadership of the lord of Uxmal, sacked
  Mayapan, and slew its ruler.</p>

  <p>All authorities, native as well as Spanish, agree that the destruction
  of Mayapan marked the end of strongly centralized government in Yucatan.
  Indeed there can be but little doubt that this event also sounded the
  death knell of Maya civilization. As one of the native chronicles tersely
  puts it, "The chiefs of the country lost their power." With the
  destruction of Mayapan the country split into a number of warring
  factions, each bent on the downfall of the others. Ancient jealousies and
  feuds, no longer held in leash by the restraining hand of Mayapan,
  doubtless revived, and soon the land was rent with strife. Presently to
  the horrors of civil war were added those of famine and pestilence, each
  of which visited the peninsula in turn, carrying off great numbers of
  people.</p>

  <p>These several calamities, however, were but harbingers of worse soon
  to come. In 1517 Francisco de Cordoba landed the first Spanish
  expedition<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> on the
  shores of Yucatan. The natives were so hostile, however, that he returned
  to Cuba, having accomplished little more than the discovery of the
  country. In the following year Juan de Grijalva descended on the
  peninsula, but he, too, met with so determined a resistance that he
  sailed away, having gained little more than hard knocks for his pains. In
  the following year (1519) Hernando Cortez landed on the northeast coast
  but reembarked in a few days for Mexico, again leaving the courageous
  natives to themselves. Seven years later, however, in 1526, Francisco
  Montejo, having been granted the title of Adelantado of Yucatan, set
  about the conquest of the country in earnest. Having obtained the
  necessary "sinews of war" through his marriage to a wealthy widow of
  Seville, he sailed with 3 ships and 500 men for Yucatan. He first landed
  on the island of Cozumel, off the northeast coast, but soon proceeded to
  the mainland and took formal possession of the country in the name of the
  King of Spain. This empty ceremony soon proved to be <!-- Page 7 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>but the prelude to a
  sanguinary struggle, which broke out almost immediately and continued
  with extraordinary ferocity for many years, the Maya fighting desperately
  in defense of their homes. Indeed, it was not until 14 years later, on
  June 11, 1541 (old style), that, the Spaniards having defeated a
  coalition of Maya chieftains near the city of Ichcanzihoo, the conquest
  was finally brought to a close and the pacification of the country
  accomplished. With this event ends the independent history of the
  Maya.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Manners and Customs</span></p>

  <p>According to Bishop Landa,<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> who wrote his remarkable history of
  Yucatan in 1565, the Maya of that day were a tall race, active and
  strong. In childhood the forehead was artificially flattened and the ears
  and nose were pierced for the insertion of earrings and nose-ornaments,
  of which the people were very fond. Squint-eye was considered a mark of
  beauty, and mothers strove to disfigure their children in this way by
  suspending pellets of wax between their eyes in order to make them
  squint, thus securing the desired effect. The faces of the younger boys
  were scalded by the application of hot cloths, to prevent the growth of
  the beard, which was not popular. Both men and women wore their hair
  long. The former had a large spot burned on the back of the head, where
  the hair always remained short. With the exception of a small queue,
  which hung down behind, the hair was gathered around the head in a braid.
  The women wore a more beautiful coiffure divided into two braids. The
  faces of both sexes were much disfigured as a result of their religious
  beliefs, which led to the practice of scarification. Tattooing also was
  common to both sexes, and there were persons in almost every community
  who were especially proficient in this art. Both men and women painted
  themselves red, the former decorating their entire bodies, and the latter
  all except their faces, which modesty decreed should be left unpainted.
  The women also anointed themselves very freely with fragrant gums and
  perfumes. They filed their teeth to sharp points, a practice which was
  thought to enhance their beauty.</p>

  <p>The clothing of the men was simple. They wore a breechclout wrapped
  several times around the loins and tied in such a way that one end fell
  in front between the legs and the other in the <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>corresponding position
  behind. These breechclouts were carefully embroidered by the women and
  decorated with featherwork. A large square cape hung from the shoulders,
  and sandals of hemp or leather completed the costume. For persons of high
  rank the apparel was much more elaborate, the humble breechclout and cape
  of the laboring man giving place to panaches of gorgeously colored
  feathers hanging from wooden helmets, rich mantles of tiger skins, and
  finely wrought ornaments of gold and jade.</p>

  <p>The women sometimes wore a simple petticoat, and a cloth covering the
  breasts and passing under the arms. More often their costume consisted of
  a single loose sacklike garment called the <i>hipil</i>, which reached to
  the feet and had slits for the arms. This garment, with the addition of a
  cloth or scarf wrapped around the shoulders, constituted the women's
  clothing a thousand years ago, just as it does to-day.</p>

  <p>In ancient times the women were very chaste and modest. When they
  passed men on the road, they stepped to one side, turning their backs and
  hiding their faces. The age of marriage was about 20, although children
  were frequently affianced when very young. When boys arrived at a
  marriageable age their fathers consulted the professional matchmakers of
  the community, to whom arrangements for marriage were ordinarily
  intrusted, it being considered vulgar for parents or their sons to take
  an active part in arranging these affairs. Having sought out the girl's
  parents, the matchmaker arranged with them the matter of the dowry, which
  the young man's father paid, his wife at the same time giving the
  necessary clothing for her son and prospective daughter-in-law. On the
  day of the wedding the relatives and guests assembled at the house of the
  young man's parents, where a great feast had been prepared. Having
  satisfied himself that the young couple had sufficiently considered the
  grave step they were about to take, the priest gave the bride to her
  husband. The ceremony closed with a feast in which all participated.
  Immediately after the wedding the young husband went to the home of his
  wife's parents, where he was obliged to work five or six years for his
  board. If he refused to comply with this custom he was driven from the
  house, and the marriage presumably was annulled. This step seems rarely
  to have been necessary, however, and the mother-in-law on her part saw to
  it that her daughter fed the young husband regularly, a practice which
  betokened their recognition of the marriage rite.</p>

  <p>Widowers and widows married without ceremony, it being considered
  sufficient for a widower to call on his prospective wife and eat in her
  house. Marriage between people of the same name was considered an evil
  practice, possibly in deference to some former exogamic law. It was
  thought improper to marry a mother-in-law or an aunt <!-- Page 9 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>by marriage, or a
  sister-in-law; otherwise a man could marry whom he would, even his first
  cousin.</p>

  <p>The Maya were of a very jealous nature and divorces were frequent.
  These were effected merely by the desertion of the husband or wife, as
  the case might be. The parents tried to bring the couple together and
  effect a reconciliation, but if their efforts proved unsuccessful both
  parties were at liberty to remarry. If there were young children the
  mother kept them; if the children were of age the sons followed the
  father, the daughters remaining with their mother. Although divorce was
  of common occurrence, it was condemned by the more respectable members of
  the community. It is interesting to note that polygamy was unknown among
  the Maya.</p>

  <p>Agriculture was the chief pursuit, corn and other grains being
  extensively cultivated, and stored against time of need in well-appointed
  granaries. Labor was largely communal; all hands joined to do one
  another's work. Bands of twenty or more each, passing from field to field
  throughout the community, quickly finished sowing or harvesting. This
  communal idea was carried to the chase, fifty or more men frequently
  going out together to hunt. At the conclusion of these expeditions the
  meat was roasted and then carried back to town. First, the lord of the
  district was given his share, after which the remainder was distributed
  among the hunters and their friends. Communal fishing parties are also
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>Another occupation in high favor was that of trade or commerce. Salt,
  cloth, and slaves were the chief articles of barter; these were carried
  as far as Tabasco. Cocoa, stone counters, and highly prized red shells of
  a peculiar kind were the media of exchange. These were accepted in return
  for all the products of the country, even including the finely worked
  stones, jades possibly, with which the chiefs adorned themselves at their
  fetes. Credit was asked and given, all debts were honestly paid, and no
  usury was exacted.</p>

  <p>The sense of justice among the Maya was highly developed. If a man
  committed an offense against one of another village, the former's lord
  caused satisfaction to be rendered, otherwise the communities would come
  to blows. Troubles between men of the same village were taken to a judge,
  who having heard both sides, fixed appropriate damages. If the malefactor
  could not pay these, the obligation extended to his wife and relatives.
  Crimes which could be satisfied by the payment of an indemnity were
  accidental killings, quarrels between man and wife, and the accidental
  destruction of property by fire. Malicious mischief could be atoned for
  only by blows and the shedding of blood. The punishment of murder was
  left in the hands of the deceased's relatives, who were at liberty to
  exact an indemnity or the murderer's life as they pleased. The thief was
  obliged to make good whatever he had stolen, no matter how little; in
  event of failure to do so he was reduced to slavery. Adultery was
  punishable by <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>death. The adulterer was led into the
  courtyard of the chief's house, where all had assembled, and after being
  tied to a stake, was turned over to the mercies of the outraged husband,
  who either pardoned him or crushed his head with a heavy rock. As for the
  guilty woman, her infamy was deemed sufficient punishment for her, though
  usually her husband abandoned her.</p>

  <p>The Maya were a very hospitable people, always offering food and drink
  to the stranger within their gates, and sharing with him to the last
  crumb. They were much given to conviviality, particularly the lords, who
  frequently entertained one another with elaborate feasts, accompanied by
  music and dancing, expending at times on a single occasion the proceeds
  of many days' accumulation. They usually sat down to eat by twos or
  fours. The meal, which consisted of vegetable stews, roast meats, corn
  cakes, and cocoa (to mention only a few of the viands) was spread upon
  mats laid on the ground. After the repast was finished beautiful young
  girls acting as cupbearers passed among the guests, plying them
  industriously with wine until all were drunk. Before departing each guest
  was presented with a handsome vase and pedestal, with a cloth cover
  therefor. At these orgies drinking was frequently carried to such excess
  that the wives of the guests were obliged to come for their besotted
  husbands and drag them home. Each of the guests at such a banquet was
  required to give one in return, and not even death could stay the payment
  of a debt of this kind, since the obligation descended to the recipient's
  heirs. The poor entertained less lavishly, as became their means. Guests
  at the humbler feasts, moreover, were not obliged to return them in
  kind.</p>

  <p>The chief amusements of the Maya were comedies and dances, in both of
  which they exhibited much skill and ingenuity. There was a variety of
  musical instruments&mdash;drums of several kinds, rattles, reed flutes,
  wooden horns, and bone whistles. Their music is described as having been
  sad, owing perhaps to the melancholy sound of the instruments which
  produced it.</p>

  <p>The frequent wars which darken the final pages of Maya history
  doubtless developed the military organization to a high degree of
  efficiency. At the head of the army stood two generals, one hereditary
  and the other elective (<i>nacon</i>), the latter serving for three
  years. In each village throughout the country certain men
  (<i>holcanes</i>) were chosen to act as soldiers; these constituted a
  kind of a standing army, thoroughly trained in the art of war. They were
  supported by the community, and in times of peace caused much
  disturbance, continuing the tumult of war after war had ceased. In times
  of great stress when it became necessary to call on all able-bodied men
  for military service, the holcanes mustered all those available in their
  respective districts and trained them in the use of arms. There were but
  few weapons: Wooden bows strung with hemp cords, and arrows <!-- Page 11
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>tipped with
  obsidian or bone; long lances with sharp flint points; and metal
  (probably copper) axes, provided with wooden handles. The defensive armor
  consisted of round wicker shields strengthened with deer hide, and
  quilted cotton coats, which were said to have extraordinary resisting
  power against the native weapons. The highest chiefs wore wooden helmets
  decorated with brilliant plumes, and cloaks of "tiger" (jaguar) skin,
  thrown over their shoulders.</p>

  <p>With a great banner at their head the troops silently stole out of the
  city, and moved against the enemy, hoping thus to surprise them. When the
  enemies' position had been ascertained, they fell on them suddenly with
  extraordinary ferocity, uttering loud cries. Barricades of trees, brush,
  and stone were used in defense, behind which archers stood, who
  endeavored to repulse the attack. After a battle the victors mutilated
  the bodies of the slain, cutting out the jawbones and cleaning them of
  flesh. These were worn as bracelets after the flesh had been removed. At
  the conclusion of their wars the spoils were offered in sacrifice. If by
  chance some leader or chief had been captured, he was sacrificed as an
  offering particularly acceptable to the gods. Other prisoners became the
  slaves of those who had captured them.</p>

  <p>The Maya entertained an excessive and constant fear of death, many of
  their religious practices having no other end in view than that of
  warding off the dread visitor. After death there followed a prolonged
  period of sadness in the bereaved family, the days being given over to
  fasting, and the more restrained indulgence in grief, and the nights to
  dolorous cries and lamentations, most pitiful to hear. Among the common
  people the dead were wrapped in shrouds; their mouths were filled with
  ground corn and bits of worked stone so that they should not lack for
  food and money in the life to come. The Maya buried their dead inside the
  houses<a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> or behind them,
  putting into the tomb idols, and objects indicating the profession of the
  deceased&mdash;if a priest, some of his sacred books; if a seer, some of
  his divinatory paraphernalia. A house was commonly abandoned after a
  death therein, unless enough remained in the household to dispel the fear
  which always followed such an occurrence.</p>

  <p>In the higher walks of life the mortuary customs were more elaborate.
  The bodies of chiefs and others of high estate were burned and their
  ashes placed in large pottery vessels. These were buried in the ground
  and temples erected over them.<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> When the deceased <!-- Page 12 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>was of very high rank the
  pottery sarcophagus took the form of a human statue. A variant of the
  above procedure was to burn only a part of the body, inclosing the ashes
  in the hollow head of a wooden statue, and sealing them in with a piece
  of skin taken from the back of the dead man's skull. The rest of the body
  was buried. Such statues were jealously preserved among the figures of
  the gods, being held in deep veneration.</p>

  <p>The lords of Mayapan had still another mortuary practice. After death
  the head was severed from the body and cooked in order to remove all
  flesh. It was then sawed in half from side to side, care being taken to
  preserve the jaw, nose, eyes, and forehead in one piece. Upon this as a
  form the features of the dead man were filled in with a kind of a gum.
  Such was their extraordinary skill in this peculiar work that the
  finished mask is said to have appeared exactly like the countenance in
  life. The carefully prepared faces, together with the statues containing
  the ashes of the dead, were deposited with their idols. Every feast day
  meats were set before them so they should lack for nothing in that other
  world whither they had gone.</p>

  <p>Very little is known about the governmental organization of the
  southern Maya, and it seems best, therefore, first to examine conditions
  in the north, concerning which the early authorities, native as well as
  Spanish, have much to say. The northern Maya lived in settlements, some
  of very considerable extent, under the rule of hereditary chiefs called
  <i>halach uinicil</i>, or "real men," who were, in fact as well as name,
  the actual rulers of the country. The settlements tributary to each
  <i>halach uinic</i> were doubtless connected by tribal ties, based on
  real or fancied blood relationship.</p>

  <p>During the period of the Triple Alliance (1000-1200 A.&nbsp;D.) there were
  probably only three of these embryonic nations: Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and
  Mayapan, among which the country seems to have been apportioned. After
  the conquest of Chichen Itza, however, the halach uinic of Mayapan
  probably attempted to establish a more autocratic form of government,
  arrogating to himself still greater power. The Spanish authorities relate
  that the chiefs of the country assembled at Mayapan, acknowledged the
  ruler of that city as their overlord, and finally agreed to live there,
  each binding himself at the same time to conduct the affairs of his own
  domain through a deputy.</p>

  <p>This attempt to unite the country under one head and bring about a
  further centralization of power ultimately failed, as has been seen,
  through the tyranny of the Cocom family, in which the office of halach
  uinic of Mayapan was vested. This tyranny led to the overthrow of the
  Cocoms and the destruction of centralized government, so that when the
  Spaniards arrived they found a number of petty chieftains, acknowledging
  no overlord, and the country in chaos.</p>

  <p>The powers of the halach uinic are not clearly understood. He seems to
  have stood at the apex of the governmental organization, and <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>doubtless his
  will prevailed just so far as he had sufficient strength to enforce it.
  The <i>batabs</i>, or underchiefs, were obliged to visit him and render
  him their homage. They also accompanied him in his tours about the
  country, which always gave rise to feasting back and forth. Finally they
  advised him on all important matters. The office would seem to have been
  no stronger in any case than its incumbent, since we hear of the halach
  uinic of Mayapan being obliged to surround himself with foreign troops in
  order to hold his people in check.</p>

  <p>Each batab governed the territory of which he was the hereditary
  ruler, instructing his heir in the duties of the position, and counseling
  that he treat the poor with benevolence and maintain peace and encourage
  industry, so that all might live in plenty. He settled all lawsuits, and
  through trusted lieutenants ordered and adjusted the various affairs of
  his domain. When he went abroad from his city or even from his house a
  great crowd accompanied him. He often visited his underchiefs, holding
  court in their houses, and meeting at night in council to discuss matters
  touching the common good. The batabs frequently entertained one another
  with dancing, hunting, and feasting. The people as a community tilled the
  batab's fields, reaped his corn, and supplied his wants in general. The
  underchiefs were similarly provided for, each according to his rank and
  needs.</p>

  <p>The <i>ahkulel</i>, the next highest official in each district, acted
  as the batab's deputy or representative; he carried a short thick baton
  in token of his office. He had charge of the localities subject to his
  master's rule as well as of the officers immediately over them. He kept
  these assistants informed as to what was needed in the batab's house, as
  birds, game, fish, corn, honey, salt, and cloth, which they supplied when
  called on. The ahkulel was, in short, a chief steward, and his house was
  the batab's business office.</p>

  <p>Another important position was that of the <i>nacon</i>, or war-chief.
  In times of war this functionary was second only to the hereditary chief,
  or batab, and was greatly venerated by all. His office was elective, the
  term being three years, during which he was obliged to refrain from
  intercourse with women, and to hold himself aloof from all.</p>

  <p>An important civil position was that held by the <i>ahholpop</i>, in
  whose keeping was the <i>tunkul</i>, or wooden drum, used in summoning
  people to the dances and public meetings, or as a tocsin in case of war.
  He had charge also of the "town hall" in which all public business was
  transacted.</p>

  <p>The question of succession is important. Bishop Landa distinctly
  states in one passage "That when the lord died, although his oldest son
  succeeded him, the others were always loved and served and even regarded
  as lords." This would seem to indicate definitely that descent was by
  primogeniture. However, another passage suggests that the oldest son did
  not always succeed his father: "The lords were the governors and
  confirmed their sons in their offices if they <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>[the sons] were
  acceptable." This suggests the possibility, at least, that primogeniture
  could sometimes be set aside, particularly when the first-born lacked the
  necessary qualifications for leadership. In a somewhat drawn-out
  statement the same authority discusses the question of "princely
  succession" among the Maya:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>If the children were too young to be intrusted with the management of
  their own affairs, these were turned over to a guardian, the nearest
  relation. He gave the children to their mothers to bring up, because
  according to their usage the mother has no power of her own. When the
  guardian was the brother of the deceased [the children's paternal uncle]
  they take the children from their mother. These guardians give what was
  intrusted to them to the heirs when they come of age, and not to do so
  was considered a great dishonesty and was the cause of much
  contention.... If when the lord died there were no sons [ready, i.&nbsp;e., of
  age] to rule and he had brothers, the oldest or most capable of his
  brothers ruled, and they [the guardians] showed the heir the customs and
  fetes of his people until he should be a man, and these brothers,
  although the heir were [ready] to rule, commanded all their lives, and,
  if there were no brothers the priests and principal people selected a man
  suitable for the position.<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The foregoing would seem to imply that the rulers were succeeded by
  their eldest sons if the latter were of age and otherwise generally
  acceptable; and that, if they were minors when their fathers died, their
  paternal uncles, if any, or otherwise some capable man selected by the
  priests, took the reins of government, instructing the heir in the duties
  of the position which he was to occupy some day; and finally that the
  regent did not lay down his authority until death, even though the heir
  had previously attained his majority. This custom is so unusual that its
  existence may well be doubted, and it is not at all improbable that
  Bishop Landa's statement to the contrary may have arisen from some
  misapprehension. Primogeniture was not confined to the executive
  succession alone, since Bishop Landa states further that the high priest
  <i>Ahau can mai</i> was succeeded in his dignity by his sons, or those
  next of kin.</p>

  <p>Nepotism doubtless prevailed extensively, all the higher offices of
  the priesthood as well as the executive offices being hereditary, and in
  all probability filled with members of the halach uinic's family.</p>

  <p>The priests instructed the younger sons of the ruling family as well
  as their own, in the priestly duties and learning; in the computation of
  years, months, and days; in unlucky times; in fetes and ceremonies; in
  the administration of the sacraments; in the practices of prophecy and
  divination; in treating the sick; in their ancient history; and finally
  in the art of reading and writing their hieroglyphics, which was taught
  only to those of high degree. Genealogies were carefully preserved, the
  term meaning "of noble birth" being <i>ah kaba</i>, "he who has a name."
  The elaborate attention given to the subject of lineage, and the
  exclusive right of the <i>ah kaba</i> to the benefits of education, show
  that in the northern part of the Maya territory at least government
  rested on the principle of hereditary succession. The accounts of native
  as well as of Spanish writers leave the impression that a system not
  unlike a modified form of feudalism prevailed.</p>

<p><!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span></p>

  <p>In attempting to gain an approximate understanding of the form of
  government which existed in the southern part of the Maya territory it is
  necessary in the absence of all documentary information to interpret the
  southern chronology, architecture, and sculpture&mdash;practically all
  that remains of the older culture&mdash;in the light of the known
  conditions in the north. The chronology of the several southern cities
  (see pl. <a href="#plate2">2</a>) indicates that many of them were
  contemporaneous, and that a few, namely, Tikal, Naranjo, Palenque, and
  Copan were occupied approximately 200 years, a much longer period than
  any of the others.<a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  These four would seem to have been centers of population for a long time,
  and at least three of them, Tikal, Palenque, and Copan, attained
  considerable size. Indeed they may well have been, like Chichen Itza,
  Uxmal, and Mayapan, at a later epoch in the north, the seats of halach
  uincil, or overlords, to whom all the surrounding chiefs were tributary.
  Geographically considered, the country was well apportioned among these
  cities: Tikal dominating the north, Palenque, the west, and Copan, the
  south.</p>

  <p>The architecture, sculpture, and hieroglyphic writing of all the
  southern centers is practically identical, even to the borrowing of
  unessential details, a condition which indicates a homogeneity only to be
  accounted for by long-continued and frequent intercourse. This
  characteristic of the culture, together with the location and
  contemporaneity of its largest centers, suggests that originally the
  southern territory was divided into several extensive political
  divisions, all in close intercourse with one another, and possibly united
  in a league similar to that which later united the principal cities of
  the north. The unmistakable priestly or religious character of the
  sculptures in the southern area clearly indicates the peaceful temper of
  the people, and the conspicuous absence of warlike subjects points
  strongly to the fact that the government was a theocracy, the highest
  official in the priesthood being at the same time, by virtue of his
  sacerdotal rank, the highest civil authority. Whether the principle of
  hereditary succession determined or even influenced the selection of
  rulers in the south is impossible to say. However, since the highest
  offices, both executive and priestly, in the north were thus filled, it
  may be assumed that similar conditions prevailed in the south,
  particularly as the northern civilization was but an outgrowth of the
  <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>southern. There is some ground for believing
  that the highest office in the south may have been elective, the term
  being a <i>hotun</i><a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
  (1,800 days), and the choice restricted to the members of a certain
  family. The existence of this restriction, which closely parallels the
  Aztec procedure in selecting rulers,<a name="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> rests on very slender evidence,
  however, so far as the Maya are concerned and is mentioned here simply by
  way of suggestion.</p>

    chief deity of the Maya Pantheon (note his name glyphs, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The religion of the ancient Maya was polytheistic, its pantheon
  containing about a dozen major deities and a host of lesser ones. At its
  head stood Itzamna, the father of the gods and creator of mankind, the
  Mayan Zeus or Jupiter. He was the personification of the East, the rising
  sun, and, by association, of light, life, and knowledge. He was the
  founder of the Maya civilization, the first priest of the Maya religion,
  the inventor of writing and books, and the great healer. Whether Itzamna
  has been identified with any of the deities in the ancient Maya
  picture-writings is uncertain, though there are strong reasons for
  believing that this deity is the god represented in figure <a
  href="#fig1">1</a>. His characteristics here are: The aged face, Roman
  nose, and sunken toothless mouth.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2. Kukulcan,
    God of Learning (note his name glyph, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Scarcely less important was the great god Kukulcan, or Feathered
  Serpent, the personification of the West. It is related of him that he
  came into Yucatan from the west and settled at Chichen Itza, where he
  ruled for many years and built a great temple. During his sojourn he is
  said to have founded the city of Mayapan, which later became so
  important. Finally, having brought the country out of war and dissension
  to peace and prosperity, he left by the same way he had entered, tarrying
  only at Chakanputun on the west coast to build a splendid temple as an
  everlasting memorial of his residence among the people. After his
  departure he was worshipped as a god because of what he had done for the
  public good. Kukulcan was the Maya counterpart of the Aztec Quetzalcoatl,
  the Mexican god of light, learning, and culture. In the Maya pantheon he
  was regarded as having been the great organizer, the founder of cities,
  the framer of laws, and the teacher of their new calendar. Indeed, his
  attributes <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>and life history are so human that it is not
  improbable he may have been an actual historical character, some great
  lawgiver and organizer, the memory of whose benefactions lingered long
  after death, and whose personality was eventually deified. The episodes
  of his life suggest he may have been the recolonizer of Chichen Itza
  after the destruction of Chakanputun. Kukulcan has been identified by
  some as the "old god" of the picture-writings (fig. <a
  href="#fig2">2</a>), whose characteristics are: Two deformed teeth, one
  protruding from the front and one from the back part of his mouth, and
  the long tapering nose. He is to be distinguished further by his peculiar
  headdress.</p>

    of Death (note his name glyphs, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The most feared and hated of all the Maya deities was Ahpuch, the Lord
  of Death, God "Barebones" as an early manuscript calls him, from whom
  evil and especially death were thought to come. He is frequently
  represented in the picture-writings (fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>), usually
  in connection with the idea of death. He is associated with human
  sacrifice, suicide by hanging, death in childbirth, and the beheaded
  captive. His characteristics are typical and unmistakable. His head is
  the fleshless skull, showing the truncated nose, the grinning teeth, and
  fleshless lower jaw, sometimes even the cranial sutures are portrayed. In
  some places the ribs and vertebrae are shown, in others the body is
  spotted black as if to suggest the discoloration of death. A very
  constant symbol is the stiff feather collar with small bells attached.
  These bells also appear as ornaments on the head, arms, and ankles. The
  to us familiar crossbones were also another Maya death symbol. Even the
  hieroglyph of this god (fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>) suggests the dread
  idea for which he stood. Note the eye closed in death.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4. The God of
    War (note his name glyph, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Closely associated with the God of Death is the God of War, who
  probably stood as well for the larger idea of death by violence. He is
  characterized (fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>) by a black line painted on his
  face, sometimes curving, sometimes straight, supposed to be symbolical of
  war paint, or, according to others, of his gaping wounds. He appears in
  the picture-writings as the Death God's companion. He presides with him
  over the body of a sacrificial victim, and again follows him applying
  torch and knife to the habitations of man. His hieroglyph shows as its
  characteristic the line of black paint (fig. <a href="#fig4">4</a>).</p>

  <p>Another unpropitious deity was Ek Ahau, the Black Captain, also a war
  god, being represented (fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>) in the
  picture-writings as armed <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span>with a spear or an ax. It was said of him
  that he was a very great and very cruel warrior, who commanded a band of
  seven blackamoors like himself. He is characterized by his black color,
  his drooping lower lip, and the two curved lines at the right of his eye.
  His hieroglyph is a black eye (fig. <a href="#fig5">5</a>).</p>

  <p>Contrasted with these gods of death, violence, and destruction was the
  Maize God, Yum Kaax, Lord of the Harvest Fields (fig. <a
  href="#fig6">6</a>). Here we have one of the most important figures in
  the whole Maya pantheon, the god of husbandry and the fruits of the
  earth, of fertility and prosperity, of growth and plenty. The Maize God
  was as well disposed toward mankind as Ahpuch and his companions were
  unpropitious. In many of the picture-writings Yum Kaax is represented as
  engaged in agricultural pursuits. He is portrayed as having for his
  head-dress a sprouting ear of corn surrounded by leaves, symbolic of
  growth, for which he stands. Even the hieroglyph of this deity (fig. <a
  href="#fig6">6</a>) embodies the same idea, the god's head merging into
  the conventionalized ear of corn surrounded by leaves.</p>

    Lord of the Harvest (note his name glyph, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Another important deity about whom little or nothing is known was
  Xaman Ek, the North Star. He is spoken of as the "guide of the
  merchants," and in keeping with that character is associated in the
  picture-writings with symbols of peace and plenty. His one characteristic
  seems to be his curious head, which also serves as his name hieroglyph
  (fig. <a href="#fig7">7</a>).</p>

  <p>Other Maya deities were: Ixchel, the Rainbow, consort of Itzamna and
  goddess of childbirth and medicine; Ixtab, patroness of hunting and
  hanging; Ixtubtun, protectress of jade cutters; Ixchebelyax, the
  inventress of painting and color designing as applied to fabrics.</p>

  <p>Although the deities above described represent only a small fraction
  of the Maya pantheon, they include, beyond all doubt, its most important
  members, the truly great, who held the powers of life and death, peace
  and war, plenty and famine&mdash;who were, in short, the arbiters of
  human destiny.</p>

  <p>The Maya conceived the earth to be a cube, which supported the
  celestial vase resting on its four legs, the four cardinal points. Out of
  this grew the Tree of Life, the flowers of which were the immortal
  principle of man, the soul. Above hung heavy clouds, the fructifying
  waters upon which all growth and life depend. The religion was dualistic
  in spirit, a constant struggle between the powers of <!-- Page 19
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>light and of
  darkness. On one side were arrayed the gods of plenty, peace, and life;
  on the other those of want, war, and destruction; and between these two
  there waged an unending strife for the control of man. This struggle
  between the powers of light and darkness is graphically portrayed in the
  picture-writings. Where the God of Life plants the tree, Death breaks it
  in twain (fig. <a href="#fig8">8</a>); where the former offers food, the
  latter raises an empty vase symbolizing famine; where one builds, the
  other destroys. The contrast is complete, the conflict eternal.</p>

  <p><a name="fig7"></a></p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:12%;">

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 7. Xaman Ek,
    the North Star God (note his name glyph, below).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Maya believed in the immortality of the soul and in a spiritual
  life hereafter. As a man lived in this world so he was rewarded in the
  next. The good and righteous went to a heaven of material delights, a
  place where rich foods never failed and pain and sorrow were unknown. The
  wicked were consigned to a hell called Mitnal, over which ruled the
  archdemon Hunhau and his minions; and here in hunger, cold, and
  exhaustion they suffered everlasting torment. The materialism of the Maya
  heaven and hell need not surprise, nor lower our estimate of their
  civilization. Similar realistic conceptions of the hereafter have been
  entertained by peoples much higher in the cultural scale than the
  Maya.</p>

    <p style="text-align:left"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 8. Conflict
    between the Gods of Life and Death (Kukulcan and Ahpuch).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Worship doubtless was the most important feature of the Maya scheme of
  existence, and an endless succession of rites and ceremonies was
  considered necessary to retain the sympathies of the good gods and to
  propitiate the malevolent ones. Bishop Landa says that the aim and object
  of all Maya ceremonies were to secure three things only: Health, life,
  and sustenance; modest enough requests to ask of any faith. The first
  step in all Maya religious rites was the expulsion of the evil spirits
  from the midst of the worshipers. This was accomplished sometimes by
  prayers and benedictions, set formulæ of proven efficacy, and sometimes
  by special sacrifices and offerings.</p>

  <p>It would take us too far afield to describe here even the more
  important ceremonies of the Maya religion. Their number was literally
  legion, and they answered almost every contingency within the range of
  human experience. First of all were the ceremonies dedicated to special
  gods, as Itzamna, Kukulcan, and Ixchel. Probably every deity in the
  pantheon, even the most insignificant, had at least one rite a year
  addressed to it alone, and the aggregate must have made a very
  considerable number. In addition there were the annual feasts of the
  ritualistic year brought around by the ever-recurring <!-- Page 20
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>seasons. Here
  may be mentioned the numerous ceremonies incident to the beginning of the
  new year and the end of the old, as the renewal of household utensils and
  the general renovation of all articles, which took place at this tine;
  the feasts of the various trades and occupations&mdash;the hunters,
  fishers, and apiarists, the farmers, carpenters, and potters, the
  stonecutters, wood carvers, and metal workers&mdash;each guild having its
  own patron deity, whose services formed another large group of
  ceremonials. A third class comprised the rites of a more personal nature,
  those connected with baptism, confession, marriage, setting out on
  journeys, and the like. Finally, there was a fourth group of ceremonies,
  held much less frequently than the others, but of far greater importance.
  Herein fall the ceremonies held on extraordinary occasions, as famine,
  drought, pestilence, victory, or defeat, which were probably solemnized
  by rites of human sacrifice.</p>

  <p>The direction of so elaborate a system of worship necessitated a
  numerous and highly organized priesthood. At the head of the hierarchy
  stood the hereditary high priest, or <i>ahaucan mai</i>, a functionary of
  very considerable power. Although he had no actual share in the
  government, his influence was none the less far-reaching, since the
  highest lords sought his advice, and deferred to his judgment in the
  administration of their affairs. They questioned him concerning the will
  of the gods on various points, and he in response framed the divine
  replies, a duty which gave him tremendous power and authority. In the
  ahuacan mai was vested also the exclusive right to fill vacancies in the
  priesthood. He examined candidates on their knowledge of the priestly
  services and ceremonies, and after their appointment directed them in the
  discharge of their duties. He rarely officiated at sacrifices except on
  occasions of the greatest importance, as at the principal feasts or in
  times of general need. His office was maintained by presents from the
  lords and enforced contributions from the priesthood throughout the
  country.</p>

  <p>The priesthood included within its ranks women as well as men. The
  duties were highly specialized and there were many different ranks and
  grades in the hierarchy. The <i>chilan</i> was one of the most important.
  This priest was carried upon the shoulders of the people when he appeared
  in public. He taught their sciences, appointed the holy days, healed the
  sick, offered sacrifices, and most important of all, gave the responses
  of the gods to petitioners. The <i>ahuai chac</i> was a priest who
  brought the rains on which the prosperity of the country was wholly
  dependent. The <i>ah macik</i> conjured the winds; the <i>ahpul</i>
  caused sickness and induced sleep; the <i>ahuai xibalba</i> communed with
  the dead. At the bottom of the ladder seems to have stood the
  <i>nacon</i>, whose duty it was to open the breasts of the sacrificed
  victims. An important elective office in each community was that held by
  the <i>chac</i>, or priest's assistant. These officials, of which there
  <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>were four, were elected from the
  <i>nucteelob</i>, or village wise men. They served for a term of one year
  and could never be reelected. They aided the priest in the various
  ceremonies of the year, officiating in minor capacities. Their duties
  seem to have been not unlike those of the sacristan in the Roman Catholic
  Church of to-day.</p>

  <p>In closing this introduction nothing could be more appropriate than to
  call attention once more to the supreme importance of religion in the
  life of the ancient Maya. Religion was indeed the very fountain-head of
  their civilization, and on its rites and observances they lavished a
  devotion rarely equaled in the annals of man. To its great uplifting
  force was due the conception and evolution of the hieroglyphic writing
  and calendar, alike the invention and the exclusive property of the
  priesthood. To its need for sanctuary may be attributed the origin of
  Maya architecture; to its desire for expression, the rise of Maya
  sculpture. All activities reflected its powerful influence and all were
  more or less dominated by its needs and teachings. In short, religion was
  the foundation upon which the structure of the Maya civilization was
  reared. <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span> THE MAYA HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING</p>

  <p>The inscriptions herein described are found throughout the region
  formerly occupied by the Maya people (pl. <a href="#plate1">1</a>),
  though by far the greater number have been discovered at the southern, or
  older, sites. This is due in part, at least, to the minor role played by
  sculpture as an independent art among the northern Maya, for in the north
  architecture gradually absorbed in its decoration the sculptural activity
  of the people which in the south had been applied in the making of the
  hieroglyphic monuments.</p>

    the glyphs: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, In the codices; <i>c</i>, in the
    inscriptions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The materials upon which the Maya glyphs are presented are stone,
  wood, stucco, bone, shell, metal, plaster, pottery, and fiber-paper; the
  first-mentioned, however, occurs more frequently than all of the others
  combined. Texts have been found carved on the wooden lintels of Tikal,
  molded in the stucco reliefs of Palenque, scratched on shells from Copan
  and Belize, etched on a bone from Wild Cane Key, British Honduras,
  engraved on metal from Chichen Itza, drawn on the plaster-covered walls
  of Kabah, Chichen Itza, and Uxmal, and painted in fiber-paper books. All
  of these, however, with the exception of the first and the last (the
  inscriptions on stone and the fiber-paper books or codices) just
  mentioned, occur so rarely that they may be dismissed from present
  consideration.</p>

  <p>The stones bearing inscriptions are found in a variety of shapes, the
  commonest being the monolithic shafts or slabs known as <i>stelæ</i>.
  Some of the shaft-stelæ attain a height of twenty-six feet (above
  ground); these are not unlike roughly squared obelisks, with human
  figures carved on the obverse and the reverse, and glyphs on the other
  faces. Slab-stelæ, on the other hand, are shorter and most of them bear
  inscriptions only on the reverse. Frequently associated with these stelæ
  are smaller monoliths known as "altars," which vary greatly in size,
  shape, and decoration, some bearing glyphs and others being without
  them.</p>

  <p>The foregoing monuments, however, by no means exhaust the list of
  stone objects that bear hieroglyphs. As an adjunct to architecture
  inscriptions occur on wall-slabs at Palenque, on lintels at Yaxchilan and
  Piedras Negras, on steps and stairways at Copan, and on piers and
  architraves at Holactun; and these do not include the great number of
  smaller pieces, as inscribed jades and the like. Most of the glyphs in
  the inscriptions are square in outline except for rounded corners (fig.
  <a href="#fig9">9</a>, <i>c</i>). Those in the codices, on the other
  hand, approximate more nearly in form rhomboids or even ovals (fig. <a
  href="#fig9">9</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). This difference in outline,
  however, is only superficial in significance and involves no
  corresponding difference in meaning between <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>otherwise identical
  glyphs; it is due entirely to the mechanical dissimilarity of the two
  materials. Disregarding this consideration as unessential, we may say
  that the glyphs in both the inscriptions and the codices belong to one
  and the same system of writing, and if it were possible to read either,
  the other could no longer withhold its meaning from us.</p>

  <p>In Maya inscriptions the glyphs are arranged in parallel columns,
  which are to be read two columns at a time, beginning with the uppermost
  glyph in the left-hand column, and then from left to right and top to
  bottom, ending with the lowest glyph in the second column. Then the next
  two columns are read in the same order, and so on. In reading glyphs in a
  horizontal band, the order is from left to right in pairs. The writer
  knows of no text in which the above order of reading is not followed.</p>

  <p>A brief examination of any Maya text, from either the inscriptions or
  the codices, reveals the presence of certain elements which occur
  repeatedly but in varying combinations. The apparent multiplicity of
  these combinations leads at first to the conclusion that a great number
  of signs were employed in Maya writing, but closer study will show that,
  as compared with the composite characters or glyphs proper, the simple
  elements are few in number. Says Doctor Brinton (1894 b: p. 10) in this
  connection: "If we positively knew the meaning ... of a hundred or so of
  these simple elements, none of the inscriptions could conceal any longer
  from us the general tenor of its contents." Unfortunately, it must be
  admitted that but little advance has been made toward the solution of
  this problem, perhaps because later students have distrusted the highly
  fanciful results achieved by the earlier writers who "interpreted" these
  "simple elements."</p>

    of glyph elision, showing elimination of all parts except essential
    element (here, the crossed bands).</p>
  </div>

  <p>Moreover, there is encountered at the very outset in the study of
  these elements a condition which renders progress slow and results
  uncertain. In Egyptian texts of any given period the simple phonetic
  elements or signs are unchanging under all conditions of composition.
  Like the letters of our own alphabet, they never vary and may be
  recognized as unfailingly. On the other hand, in Maya texts each glyph is
  in itself a finished picture, dependent on no other for its meaning, and
  consequently the various elements entering into it undergo very
  considerable modifications in order that the resulting composite
  character may not only be a balanced and harmonious <!-- Page 24 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>design, but also may
  exactly fill its allotted space. All such modifications probably in no
  way affect the meaning of the element thus mutilated.</p>

    Normal-form and head-variant glyphs, showing retention of essential
    element in each.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The element shown in figure <a href="#fig10">10</a>, <i>a-e</i> is a
  case in point. In <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> we have what may be called the
  normal or regular forms of this element. In <i>c</i>, however, the upper
  arm has been omitted for the sake of symmetry in a composite glyph, while
  in <i>d</i> the lower arm has been left out for want of space. Finally in
  <i>e</i> both arms have disappeared and the element is reduced to the
  sign (*<img src="images/glyph24a.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:4.86ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which we may conclude, therefore, is the essential characteristic of
  this glyph, particularly since there is no regularity in the treatment of
  the arms in the normal forms. This suggests another point of the utmost
  importance, namely, the determination of the essential elements of Maya
  glyphs. The importance of this point lies in the fact that great license
  was permitted in the treatment of accessory elements so long as the
  essential element or elements of a glyph could readily be recognized as
  such. In this way may be explained the use of the so-called "head"
  variants, in which the outline of the glyph was represented as a human or
  a grotesque head modified in some way by the essential element of the
  intended form. The first step in the development of head variants is seen
  in figure <a href="#fig11">11</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, in which the
  entire glyph <i>a</i> is used as a headdress in glyph <i>b</i>, the
  meaning of the two forms remaining identical. The next step is shown in
  the same figure, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, in which the outline of the
  entire glyph <i>c</i> has been changed to form the grotesque head
  <i>d</i>, though in both glyphs the essential elements are the same. A
  further development was to apply the essential element (**<img
  src="images/glyph24b-c.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) of <i>e</i> to the head in <i>f</i>, giving rise to a head variant,
  the meaning of which suffered no corresponding change. The element
  (&dagger;) in figure <a href="#fig11">11</a>, <i>g</i>, has been reduced
  in size in <i>h</i>, though the other two essential elements remain
  unchanged. A final step appears in <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, where in
  <i>j</i> the position of one of the two essential elements of <i>i</i>
  (&dagger;&dagger;<img src="images/glyph24d-e.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.07ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) and the form of the other (&Dagger;) have been changed. These
  variants <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>are puzzling enough when the essential
  characteristics and meaning of a glyph have been determined, but when
  both are unknown the problem is indeed knotty. For example, it would seem
  as a logical deduction from the foregoing examples, that <i>l</i> of
  figure <a href="#fig11">11</a> is a "head" variant of <i>k</i>; and
  similarly <i>n</i> might be a "head" variant of <i>m</i>, but here we are
  treading on uncertain ground, as the meanings of these forms are
  unknown.</p>

  <p>Nor is this feature of Maya writing (i.&nbsp;e., the presence of "head
  variants") the only pitfall which awaits the beginner who attempts to
  classify the glyphs according to their appearance. In some cases two
  entirely dissimilar forms express exactly the same idea. For example, no
  two glyphs could differ more in appearance than <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
  figure <a href="#fig12">12</a>, yet both of these forms have the same
  meaning. This is true also of the two glyphs <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, and
  <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. The occurrence of forms so absolutely unlike in
  appearance, yet identical in meaning, greatly complicates the problem of
  glyph identification. Indeed, identity in both meaning and use must be
  clearly established before we can recognize as variants of the same
  glyph, forms so dissimilar as the examples above given. Hence, because
  their meanings are unknown we are unable to identify <i>g</i> and
  <i>h</i>, figure <a href="#fig12">12</a>, as synonyms, notwithstanding
  the fact that their use seems to be identical, <i>h</i> occurring in two
  or three texts under exactly the same conditions as does <i>g</i> in all
  the others.</p>

    Normal-form and head-variant glyphs, showing absence of common
    essential element.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A further source of error in glyph identification is the failure to
  recognize variations due merely to individual peculiarities of style,
  which are consequently unessential. Just as handwriting differs in each
  individual, so the delineation of glyphs differed among the ancient Maya,
  though doubtless to a lesser extent. In extreme cases, however, the
  differences are so great that identification of variants as forms of one
  and the same glyph is difficult if indeed not impossible. Here also are
  to be included variations due to differences in the materials upon which
  the glyphs are delineated, as well as those arising from careless drawing
  and actual mistakes.</p>

  <p>The foregoing difficulties, as well as others which await the student
  who would classify the Maya glyphs according to form and appearance, have
  led the author to discard this method of classification as unsuited to
  the purposes of an elementary work. Though a problem of first importance,
  the analysis of the simple elements is far too complex for presentation
  to the beginner, particularly since the <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>greatest diversity of
  opinion concerning them prevails among those who have studied the
  subject, scarcely any two agreeing at any one point; and finally because
  up to the present time success in reading Maya writing has not come
  through this channel.</p>

  <p>The classification followed herein is based on the general meaning of
  the glyphs, and therefore has the advantage of being at least
  self-explanatory. It divides the glyphs into two groups: (1)
  Astronomical, calendary, and numerical signs, that is, glyphs used in
  counting time; and (2) glyphs accompanying the preceding, which have an
  explanatory function of some sort, probably describing the nature of the
  occasions which the first group of glyphs designate.</p>

  <p>According to this classification, the great majority of the glyphs
  whose meanings have been determined fall into the first group, and those
  whose meanings are still unknown into the second. This is particularly
  true of the inscriptions, in which the known glyphs practically all
  belong to the first group. In the codices, on the other hand, some little
  progress has made been in reading glyphs of the second group. The
  name-glyphs of the principal gods, the signs for the cardinal points and
  associated colors, and perhaps a very few others may be mentioned in this
  connection.<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of the unknown glyphs in both the inscriptions and the codices, a part
  at least have to do with numerical calculations of some kind, a fact
  which relegates such glyphs to the first group. The author believes that
  as the reading of the Maya glyphs progresses, more and more characters
  will be assigned to the first group and fewer and fewer to the second. In
  the end, however, there will be left what we may perhaps call a "textual
  residue," that is, those glyphs which explain the nature of the events
  that are to be associated with the corresponding chronological parts. It
  is here, if anywhere, that fragments of Maya history will be found
  recorded, and precisely here is the richest field for future research,
  since the successful interpretation of this "textual residue" will alone
  disclose the true meaning of the Maya writings.</p>

  <p>Three principal theories have been advanced for the interpretation of
  Maya writing:</p>

  <p>1. That the glyphs are phonetic, each representing some sound, and
  entirely dissociated from the representation of any thought or idea.</p>

  <p>2. That the glyphs are ideographic, each representing in itself some
  complete thought or idea.</p>

  <p>3. That the glyphs are both phonetic and ideographic, that is, a
  combination of 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>It is apparent at the outset that the first of these theories can not
  be accepted in its entirety; for although there are undeniable traces
  <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>of
  phoneticism among the Maya glyphs, all attempts to reduce them to a
  phonetic system or alphabet, which will interpret the writing, have
  signally failed. The first and most noteworthy of these so-called "Maya
  alphabets," because of its genuine antiquity, is that given by Bishop
  Landa in his invaluable <i>Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan</i>,
  frequently cited in Chapter I. Writing in the year 1565, within 25 years
  of the Spanish Conquest, Landa was able to obtain characters for 27
  sounds, as follows: Three <i>a's</i>, two <i>b's</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>t</i>,
  <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>ca</i>, <i>k</i>, two <i>l's</i>,
  <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, two <i>o's</i>, <i>pp</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>cu</i>,
  <i>ku</i>, two <i>x's</i>, two <i>v's</i>, <i>z</i>. This alphabet, which
  was first published in 1864 by Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg (see Landa,
  1864), was at once heralded by Americanists as the long-awaited key which
  would unlock the secrets of the Maya writing. Unfortunately these
  confident expectations have not been realized, and all attempts to read
  the glyphs by means of this alphabet or of any of the numerous others<a
  name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> which have appeared
  since, have completely broken down.</p>

  <p>This failure to establish the exclusive phonetic character of the Maya
  glyphs has resulted in the general acceptance of the second theory, that
  the signs are ideographic. Doctor Brinton (1894b: p. 14), however, has
  pointed out two facts deducible from the Landa alphabet which render
  impossible not only the complete acceptance of this second theory but
  also the absolute rejection of the first: (1) That a native writer was
  able to give a written character for an unfamiliar sound, a sound,
  moreover, which was without meaning to him, as, for example, that of a
  Spanish letter; and (2) that the characters he employed for this purpose
  were also used in the native writings. These facts Doctor Brinton regards
  as proof that some sort of phonetic writing was not unknown, and, indeed,
  both the inscriptions and the codices establish the truth of this
  contention. For example, the sign in <i>a</i>, figure <a
  href="#fig13">13</a>, has the phonetic value <i>kin</i>, and the sign in
  <i>b</i> the phonetic value <i>yax</i>. In the latter glyph, however,
  only the upper part (reproduced in <i>c</i>) is to be regarded as the
  essential element. It is strongly indicative of phoneticism therefore to
  find the sound <i>yaxkin</i>, a combination of these two, expressed by
  the sign found in <i>d</i>. Similarly, the character representing the
  phonetic value <i>kin</i> is found also as an element in the glyphs for
  the words <i>likin</i> <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>and <i>chikin</i> (see <i>e</i> and
  <i>f</i>, respectively, fig. <a href="#fig13">13</a>), each of which has
  <i>kin</i> as its last syllable. Again, the phonetic value <i>tun</i> is
  expressed by the glyph in <i>g</i>, and the sound <i>ca</i> (<i>c</i>
  hard) by the sign <i>h</i>. The sound <i>katun</i> is represented by the
  character in <i>i</i>, a combination of these two. Sometimes the glyph
  for this same sound takes the form of <i>j</i>, the fish element in
  <i>k</i> replacing the comblike element <i>h</i>. Far from destroying the
  phonetic character of this composite glyph, however, this variant
  <i>k</i> in reality strengthens it, since in Maya the word for fish is
  <i>cay</i> (<i>c</i> hard) and consequently the variant reads
  <i>caytun</i>, a close phonetic approximation of <i>katun</i>. The
  remaining element of this glyph (<i>l</i>) has the value <i>cauac</i>,
  the first syllable of which is also expressed by either <i>h</i> or
  <i>k</i>, figure <a href="#fig13">13</a>. Its use in <i>i</i> and
  <i>j</i> probably may be regarded as but a further emphasis of the
  phonetic character of the glyph.</p>

  <p>It must be remembered, however, that all of the above glyphs have
  meanings quite independent of their phonetic values, that primarily their
  function was to convey ideas, and that only secondarily were they used in
  their phonetic senses.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 13. Glyphs
    built up on a phonetic basis.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If neither the phonetic nor the ideographic character of the glyphs
  can be wholly admitted, what then is the true nature of the Maya writing?
  The theory now most generally accepted is, that while chiefly
  ideographic, the glyphs are sometimes phonetic, and that although the
  idea of a glyphic alphabet must finally be abandoned, the phonetic use of
  syllables as illustrated above must as surely be recognized.</p>

  <p>This kind of writing Doctor Brinton has called <i>ikonomatic</i>, more
  familiarly known to us under the name of rebus, or puzzle writing. In
  such writing the characters do not indicate the ideas of the objects
  which they portray, but only the sounds of their names, and are used
  purely in a phonetic sense, like the letters of the alphabet. For
  example, the rebus in figure <a href="#fig14">14</a> reads as follows: "I
  believe Aunt Rose can well bear all for you." The picture of the eye
  recalls not the idea "eye" but the sound of the word denoting this
  object, which is also the sound of the word for the first person singular
  of the <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>personal pronoun I. Again, the picture of a
  bee does not represent the idea of that insect, but stands for the sound
  of its name, which used with a leaf indicates the sound "beeleaf," or in
  other words, "believe."<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It has long been known that the Aztec employed ikonomatic characters
  in their writing to express the names of persons and places, though this
  practice does not seem to have been extended by them to the
  representation of abstract words. The Aztec codices contain many glyphs
  which are to be interpreted ikonomatically, that is, like our own rebus
  writing. For example in figure <a href="#fig15">15</a>, <i>a</i>, is
  shown the Aztec hieroglyph for the town of Toltitlan, a name which means
  "near the place of the rushes." The word <i>tollin</i> means "place of
  the rushes," but only its first syllable <i>tol</i> appears in the word
  Toltitlan. This syllable is represented in <i>a</i> by several rushes.
  The word <i>tetlan</i> means "near something" and its second syllable
  <i>tlan</i> is found also in the word <i>tlantli</i>, meaning "teeth." In
  <i>a</i> therefore, the addition of the teeth to the rushes gives the
  word Toltitlan. Another example of this kind of writing is given in
  figure <a href="#fig15">15</a>, <i>b</i>, where the hieroglyph for the
  town of Acatzinco is shown. This word means "the little reed grass," the
  diminutive being represented by the syllable <i>tzinco</i>. The reed
  grass (<i>acatl</i>) is shown by the pointed leaves or spears which
  emerge from the lower part of a human figure. This part of the body was
  called by the Aztecs <i>tzinco</i>, and as used here expresses merely the
  sound <i>tzinco</i> in the diminutive <i>acatzinco</i>, "the little reed
  grass," the letter <i>l</i> of <i>acatl</i> being lost in
  composition.</p>

    corresponding manner.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The presence of undoubted phonetic elements in these Aztec glyphs
  expressing personal names and place names would seem to indicate that
  some similar usage probably prevailed among the Maya. <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>While admitting
  this restricted use of phonetic composition by the Maya, Professor Seler
  refuses to recognize its further extension:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>Certainly there existed in the Maya writing compound hieroglyphs
  giving the name of a deity, person, or a locality, whose elements united
  on the phonetic principle. But as yet it is not proved that they wrote
  texts. And without doubt the greater part of the Maya hieroglyphics were
  conventional symbols built up on the ideographic principle.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Doctor Förstemann also regards the use of phonetic elements as
  restricted to little more than the above when he says, "Finally the
  graphic system of the Maya ... never even achieved the expression of a
  phrase or even a verb."</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 255) considers the use of
  phonetic composition extended considerably beyond these limits:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>As far as I am aware, the use of this kind of writing [rebus] was
  confined, among the Aztecs, to the names of persons and places, while the
  Mayas, if they used the rebus form at all, used it also for expressing
  common nouns and possibly abstract ideas. The Mayas surely used picture
  writing and the ideographic system, but I feel confident that a large
  part of their hieroglyphs will be found to be made up of rebus forms and
  that the true line of research will be found to lie in this
  direction.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Doctor Brinton (1894 b: p. 13) held an opinion between these two,
  perhaps inclining slightly toward the former: "The intermediate position
  which I have defended, is that while chiefly ideographic, they [the Maya
  glyphs] are occasionally phonetic, in the same manner as are confessedly
  the Aztec picture-writings."</p>

  <p>These quotations from the most eminent authorities on the subject well
  illustrate their points of agreement and divergence. All admit the
  existence of phonetic elements in the glyphs, but disagree as to their
  extent. And here, indeed, is the crux of the whole phonetic question.
  Just how extensively do phonetic elements enter into the composition of
  the Maya glyphs? Without attempting to dispose of this point definitely
  one way or the other, the author may say that he believes that as the
  decipherment of Maya writing progresses, more and more phonetic elements
  will be identified, though the idea conveyed by a glyph will always be
  found to overshadow its phonetic value.</p>

  <p>The various theories above described have not been presented for the
  reader's extended consideration, but only in order to acquaint him with
  the probable nature of the Maya glyphs. Success in deciphering, as we
  shall see, has not come through any of the above mentioned lines of
  research, which will not be pursued further in this work. <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span></p>

  <p>In taking up the question of the meaning of Maya writing, it must be
  admitted at the outset that in so far as they have been deciphered both
  the inscriptions and the codices have been found to deal primarily, if
  indeed not exclusively, with the counting of time in some form or other.
  Doctor Förstemann, the first successful interpreter of the codices, has
  shown that these writings have for their principal theme the passage of
  time in its varying relations to the Maya calendar, ritual, and
  astronomy. They deal in great part with the sacred year of 260 days,
  known to the Aztec also under the name of the <i>tonalamatl</i>, in
  connection with which various ceremonies, offerings, sacrifices, and
  domestic occupations are set forth. Doctor Förstemann believed that this
  260-day period was employed by the priests in casting horoscopes and
  foretelling the future of individuals, classes, and tribes, as well as in
  predicting coming political events and natural phenomena; or in other
  words, that in so far as the 260-day period was concerned, the codices
  are nothing more nor less than books of prophecy and divination.</p>

  <p>The prophetic character of some of these native books at least is
  clearly indicated in a passage from Bishop Landa's <i>Relacion</i> (p.
  286). In describing a festival held in the month Uo, the Bishop relates
  that "the most learned priest opened a book, in which he examined the
  omens of the year, which he announced to all those who were present."
  Other early Spanish writers state that these books contain the ancient
  prophecies and indicate the times appointed for their fulfillment.</p>

  <p>Doctor Thomas regarded the codices as religious calendars, or rituals
  for the guidance of the priests in the celebration of feasts, ceremonies,
  and other duties, seemingly a natural inference from the character of the
  scenes portrayed in connection with these 260-day periods.</p>

  <p>Another very important function of the codices is the presentation of
  astronomical phenomena and calculations. The latter had for their
  immediate object in each case the determination of the lowest number
  which would exactly contain all the numbers of a certain group. These
  lowest numbers are in fact nothing more nor less than the least common
  multiple of changing combinations of numbers, each one of which
  represents the revolution of some heavenly body. In addition to these
  calculations deities are assigned to the several periods, and a host of
  mythological allusions are introduced, the significance of most of which
  is now lost.</p>

  <p>The most striking proof of the astronomical character of the codices
  is to be seen in pages 46-50 of the Dresden Manuscript. Here, to begin
  with, a period of 2,920 days is represented, which exactly contains five
  Venus years of 584<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> days
  each (one on each page) as well as eight solar years of 365 days each.
  Each of the Venus years is divided into four parts, respectively, 236,
  90, 250, and 8 days. The <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>first and third of these constitute the
  periods when Venus was the morning and the evening star, respectively,
  and the second and fourth, the periods of invisibility after each of
  these manifestations. This Venus-solar period of 2,920 days was taken as
  the basis from which the number 37,960 was formed. This contains 13
  Venus-solar periods, 65 Venus-years, 104 solar years, and 146
  <i>tonalamatls</i>, or sacred years of 260 days each. Finally, the last
  number (37,960) with all the subdivisions above given was thrice
  repeated, so that these five pages of the manuscript record the passage
  of 113,880 days, or 312 solar years.</p>

  <p>Again, on pages 51-58 of the same manuscript, 405 revolutions of the
  moon are set down; and so accurate are the calculations involved that
  although they cover a period of nearly 33 years the total number of days
  recorded (11,959) is only <span class="spp">89</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">100</span> of a day less than the true time computed by the
  best modern method<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>&mdash;certainly a remarkable
  achievement for the aboriginal mind. It is probable that the revolutions
  of the planets Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn are similarly recorded
  in the same manuscript.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the Dresden Codex the numbers become greater and
  greater until, in the so-called "serpent numbers," a grand total of
  nearly twelve and a half million days (about thirty-four thousand years)
  is recorded again and again. In these well-nigh inconceivable periods all
  the smaller units may be regarded as coming at last to a more or less
  exact close. What matter a few score years one way or the other in this
  virtual eternity? Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is
  depicted the Destruction of the World (see pl. <a href="#plate3">3</a>),
  for which these highest numbers have paved the way. Here we see the rain
  serpent, stretching across the sky, belching forth torrents of water.
  Great streams of water gush from the sun and moon. The old goddess, she
  of the tiger claws and forbidding aspect, the malevolent patroness of
  floods and cloudbursts, overturns the bowl of the heavenly waters. The
  crossbones, dread emblem of death, decorate her skirt, and a writhing
  snake crowns her head. Below with downward-pointed spears, symbolic of
  the universal destruction, the black god stalks abroad, a screeching bird
  raging on his fearsome head. Here, indeed, is portrayed with graphic
  touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm.</p>

  <p>According to the early writers, in addition to the astronomic,
  prophetic, and ritualistic material above described, the codices
  contained records of historical events. It is doubtful whether this is
  true of any of the three codices now extant, though there are grounds for
  believing that the Codex Peresianus may be in part at least of an
  historical nature.</p>

  <p>Much less progress has been made toward discovering the meaning of the
  inscriptions. Doctor Brinton (1894 b: p.32) states:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>My own conviction is that they [the inscriptions and codices] will
  prove to be much more astronomical than even the latter [Doctor
  Förstemann] believes; that they are primarily and essentially records of
  the motions of the heavenly bodies; and that both figures and characters
  are to be interpreted as referring in the first instance to the sun and
  moon, the planets, and those constellations which are most prominent in
  the nightly sky in the latitude of Yucatan.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 199) has also brought forward very cogent
  points tending to show that in part at least the inscriptions treat of
  the intercalation of days necessary to bring the dated monuments, based
  on a 365-day year, into harmony with the true solar year of 365.2421
  days.<a name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>While admitting that the inscriptions may, and probably do, contain
  such astronomical matter as Doctor Brinton and Mr. Bowditch have
  suggested, the writer believes nevertheless that fundamentally they are
  historical; that the monuments upon which they are presented were erected
  and inscribed on or about the dates they severally record; and finally,
  that the great majority of these dates are those of contemporaneous
  events, and as such pertain to the subject-matter of history.</p>

  <p>The reasons which have led him to this conclusion follow:</p>

  <p><i>First.</i> The monuments at most of the southern Maya sites show a
  certain periodicity in their sequence. This is most pronounced at
  Quirigua, where all of the large monuments fall into an orderly series,
  in which each monument is dated exactly 1,800 days later than the one
  immediately preceding it in the sequence. This is also true at Copan,
  where, in spite of the fact that there are many gaps in the sequence,
  enough monuments conforming to the plan remain to prove its former
  existence. The same may be said also of Naranjo, Seibal, and Piedras
  Negras, and in fact of almost all the other large cities which afford
  sufficient material for a chronological arrangement.</p>

  <p>This interval of 1,800 days quite obviously was not determined by the
  recurrence of any natural phenomenon. It has no parallel in nature, but
  is, on the contrary, a highly artificial unit. Consequently, monuments
  the erection of which was regulated by the successive returns of this
  period could not depend in the least for the fact of their existence on
  any astronomical phenomenon other than that of the rising and setting of
  eighteen hundred successive suns, an arbitrary period.</p>

  <p>The Maya of Yucatan had a similar method of marking time, though their
  unit of enumeration was 7,200 days, or four times the <!-- Page 34
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>length of the
  one used for the same purpose in the older cities. The following
  quotations from early Spanish chroniclers explain this practice and
  indicate that the inscriptions presented on these time-markers were of an
  historical nature:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>There were discovered in the plaza of that city [Mayapan] seven or
  eight stones each ten feet in length, round at the end, and well worked.
  These had some writings in the characters which they use, but were so
  worn by water that they could not be read. Moreover, they think them to
  be in memory of the foundation and destruction of that city. There are
  other similar ones, although higher, at Zilan, one of the coast towns.
  The natives when asked what these things were, replied that they were
  accustomed to erect one of these stones every twenty years, which is the
  number they use for counting their ages.<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The other is even more explicit:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>Their lustras having reached five in number, which made twenty years,
  which they call a katun, they place a graven stone on another of the same
  kind laid in lime and sand in the walls of their temples and the houses
  of the priests, as one still sees to-day in the edifices in question, and
  in some ancient walls of our own convent at Merida, about which there are
  some cells. In a city named Tixhualatun, which signifies "place where one
  graven stone is placed upon another," they say are their archives, where
  everybody had recourse for events of all kinds, as we do to Simancas.<a
  name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It seems almost necessary to conclude from such a parallel that the
  inscriptions of the southern cities will also be found to treat of
  historical matters.</p>

  <p><i>Second.</i> When the monuments of the southern cities are arranged
  according to their art development, that is, in stylistic sequence, they
  are found to be arranged in their chronological order as well. This
  important discovery, due largely to the researches of Dr. H. J. Spinden,
  has enabled us to determine the relative ages of various monuments quite
  independent of their respective dates. From a stylistic consideration
  alone it has been possible not only to show that the monuments date from
  different periods, but also to establish the sequence of these periods
  and that of the monuments in them. Finally, it has demonstrated beyond
  all doubt that the great majority of the dates on Maya monuments refer to
  the time of their erection, so that the inscriptions which they present
  are historical in that they are the contemporaneous records of different
  epochs.</p>

  <p><i>Third.</i> The dates on the monuments are such as to constitute a
  strong antecedent probability of their historical character. Like the
  records of most ancient peoples, the Maya monuments, judging from their
  dates, were at first scattered and few. Later, as new cities were founded
  and the nation waxed stronger and stronger, the number of monuments
  increased, until at the flood tide of Maya prosperity they were,
  comparatively speaking, common. Finally, as decline set in, fewer and
  fewer monuments were erected, and eventually effort in this field ceased
  altogether. The increasing number of the monuments by ten-year periods is
  shown in plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, where the passage of time (i.&nbsp;e.,
  the successive ten-year periods) is represented from left to right, and
  the number of dates in each ten-year period from bottom to top. Although
  other dated monuments will be found from time to time, which will
  necessarily change the details given in this diagram, such additional
  evidence in all probability will never controvert the following general
  conclusions, embodied in what has just been stated, which are deducible
  from it:</p>

  <p><a name="plate4"></a></p>

<p class="ac">BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY<span class="gap" style="width:10em;"></span>BULLETIN 57 PLATE 4</p>

      <a href="images/pl04.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/pl04.jpg"

    <p style="text-align:center">DIAGRAM SHOWING OCCURRENCE OF DATES
    RECORDED IN CYCLE 9</p>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>

  <p>1. At first there was a long period of slow growth represented by few
  monuments, which, however, increased in number toward the end.</p>

  <p>2. This was followed without interruption by a period of increased
  activity, the period from which the great majority of the monuments
  date.</p>

  <p>3. Finally this period came to rather an abrupt end, indicated by the
  sudden cessation in the erection of dated monuments.</p>

  <p>The consideration of these indisputable facts tends to establish the
  historical rather than the astronomical character of the monuments. For
  had the erection of the monuments depended on the successive recurrences
  of some astronomical phenomenon, there would be corresponding intervals
  between the dates of such monuments<a name="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> the length of which would indicate the
  identity of the determining phenomenon; and they would hardly have
  presented the same logical increase due to the natural growth of a
  nation, which the accompanying diagram clearly sets forth.</p>

  <p><i>Fourth.</i> Although no historical codices<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> are known to have survived, history was
  undoubtedly recorded in these ancient Maya books. The statements of the
  early Spanish writers are very explicit on this point, as the following
  quotations from their works will show. Bishop Landa (here, as always, one
  of the most reliable authorities) says: "And the sciences which they [the
  priests] taught were the count of the years, months and days, the feasts
  and ceremonies, the administration of their sacraments, days, and fatal
  times, their methods of divination and prophecy, and foretelling events,
  and the remedies for the sick, and <i>their antiquities</i>" [p. 44]. And
  again, "they [the priests] attended the service of the temples and to the
  teaching of their sciences and <i>how to write them in their books</i>."
  And again, [p. 316], "This people also used certain characters or letters
  with which <i>they wrote in their books their ancient matters</i> and
  sciences."</p>

  <p>Father Lizana says (see Landa, 1864: p. 352): "The <i>history and
  authorities we can cite</i> are certain ancient characters, scarcely
  understood by many and explained by some old Indians, sons of the priests
  <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span>of
  their gods, who alone knew how to read and expound them and who were
  believed in and revered as much as the gods themselves."</p>

  <p>Father Ponce (tome <span class="sm">LVIII</span>, p. 392) who visited
  Yucatan as early as 1588, is equally clear: "The natives of Yucatan are
  among all the inhabitants of New Spain especially deserving of praise for
  three things. First that before the Spaniards came they made use of
  characters and letters with which <i>they wrote out their histories</i>,
  their ceremonies, the order of sacrifices to their idols and their
  calendars in books made of the bark of a certain tree."</p>

  <p>Doctor Aguilar, who wrote but little later (1596), gives more details
  as to the kind of events which were recorded. "On these [the fiber books]
  they painted in color the reckoning of their years, wars, pestilences,
  hurricanes, inundations, famines and other events."</p>

  <p>Finally, as late as 1697, some of these historical codices were in the
  possession of the last great independent Maya ruler, one Canek. Says
  Villagutierre (1701: lib. <span class="sm">VI</span>, cap. <span
  class="sm">IV</span>) in this connection: "Because their king [Canek] had
  read it in his <i>analtehes</i> [fiber-books or codices] they had
  knowledge of the provinces of Yucatan, and of the fact that their
  ancestors had formerly come from them; <i>analtehes</i> or histories
  being one and the same thing."</p>

  <p>It is clear from the foregoing extracts, that the Maya of Yucatan
  recorded their history up to the time of the Spanish Conquest, in their
  hieroglyphic books, or codices. That fact is beyond dispute. It must be
  remembered also in this connection, that the Maya of Yucatan were the
  direct inheritors of that older Maya civilization in the south, which had
  produced the hieroglyphic monuments. For this latter reason the writer
  believes that the practice of recording history in the hieroglyphic
  writing had its origin, along with many another custom, in the southern
  area, and consequently that the inscriptions on the monuments of the
  southern cities are probably, in part at least, of an historical
  nature.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the meaning of the undeciphered glyphs, enough has
  been said in this chapter about those of known meaning to indicate the
  extreme importance of the element of time in Maya writing. The very great
  preponderance of astronomical, calendary, and numerical signs in both the
  codices and the inscriptions has determined, so far as the beginner is
  concerned, the best way to approach the study of the glyphs. First, it is
  essential to understand thoroughly the Maya system of counting time, in
  other words, their calendar and chronology. Second, in order to make use
  of this knowledge, as did the Maya, it is necessary to familiarize
  ourselves with their arithmetic and its signs and symbols. Third, and
  last, after this has been accomplished, we are ready to apply ourselves
  to the deciphering of the inscriptions and the codices. For this reason
  the next chapter will be devoted to the discussion of the Maya system of
  counting time. <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> III. HOW THE MAYA RECKONED TIME</p>

  <p>Among all peoples and in all ages the most obvious unit for the
  measurement of time has been the day; and the never-failing reappearance
  of light after each interval of darkness has been the most constant
  natural phenomenon with which the mind of man has had to deal. From the
  earliest times successive returns of the sun have regulated the whole
  scheme of human existence. When it was light, man worked; when it was
  dark, he rested. Conformity to the operation of this natural law has been
  practically universal.</p>

  <p>Indeed, as primitive man saw nature, day was the only division of time
  upon which he could absolutely rely. The waxing and waning of the moon,
  with its everchanging shape and occasional obscuration by clouds, as well
  as its periodic disappearances from the heavens all combined to render
  that luminary of little account in measuring the passage of time. The
  round of the seasons was even more unsatisfactory. A late spring or an
  early winter by hastening or retarding the return of a season caused the
  apparent lengths of succeeding years to vary greatly. Even where a
  365-day year had been determined, the fractional loss, amounting to a day
  every four years, soon brought about a discrepancy between the calendar
  and the true year. The day, therefore, as the most obvious period in
  nature, as well as the most reliable, has been used the world over as the
  fundamental unit for the measurement of longer stretches of time.</p>

  <p>In conformity with the universal practice just mentioned the Maya made
  the day, which they called <i>kin</i>, the primary unit of their
  calendar. There were twenty such units, named as in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a>; these followed each other in the order there shown.
  When <b>Ahau</b>, the last day in the list, had been reached, the count
  began anew with <b>Imix</b>, and thus repeated itself again and again
  without interruption, throughout time. It is important that the student
  should fix this <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span>Maya conception of the rotation of days
  firmly in his mind at the outset, since all that is to follow depends
  upon the absolute continuity of this twenty-day sequence in endless

  </div>

  <p>The glyphs for these twenty days are shown in figures <a
  href="#fig16">16</a> and <a href="#fig17">17</a>. The forms in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a> are from the inscriptions and those in figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a> from the codices. In several cases variants are
  given to facilitate identification. A study of the glyphs in these two
  figures shows on the whole a fairly close similarity between the forms
  for the same <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>day in each. The sign for the first day,
  <b>Imix</b>, is practically identical in both. Compare figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, with figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The usual form for the day
  <b>Ik</b> in the inscriptions (see fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>c</i>), however, is unlike the glyph for the same day in the codices
  (fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>). The forms for
  <b>Akbal</b> and <b>Kan</b> are practically the same in each (see fig. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i>, and fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, respectively). The day
  <b>Chicchan</b>, figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>g</i>, occurs rarely
  in the inscriptions; when present, it takes the <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>form of a grotesque head.
  In the codices the common form for this day is very different (fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>g</i>). The head variant, however (fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>h</i>), shows a slightly closer similarity to
  the form from the inscriptions. The forms in both figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, and figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, for the day <b>Cimi</b> show
  little resemblance to each other. Although figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>i</i>, represents the common form in the
  codices, the variant in <i>j</i> more closely resembles the form in
  figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>. The day <b>Manik</b>
  is practically the same in both (see figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>j</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>k</i>), as is also <b>Lamat</b>
  (figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, and <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>). The day <b>Muluc</b> occurs
  rarely in the inscriptions (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>m</i>,
  <i>n</i>). Of these two variants <i>m</i> more closely resembles the form
  from the codices (fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>n</i>). The glyph for
  the day <b>Oc</b> (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>,
  <i>q</i>) is not often found in the inscriptions. In the codices, on the
  other hand, this day is frequently represented as shown in figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>o</i>. This form bears no resemblance to the
  forms in the inscriptions. There is, however, a head-variant form found
  very rarely in the codices that bears a slight resemblance to the forms
  in the inscriptions. The day <b>Chuen</b> occurs but once in the
  inscriptions where the form is clear enough to distinguish its
  characteristic (see fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>r</i>). This form
  bears a general resemblance to the glyph for this day in the codices
  (fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>). The forms for the day
  <b>Eb</b> in both figures <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>,
  <i>u</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>r</i>, are grotesque heads
  showing but remote resemblance to one another. The essential element in
  both, however, is the same, that is, the element occupying the position
  of the ear. Although the day <b>Ben</b> occurs but rarely in the
  inscriptions, its form (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>v</i>) is
  practically identical with that in the codices (see fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>s</i>). The day <b>Ix</b> in the inscriptions
  appears as in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>. The
  form in the codices is shown in figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>t</i>.
  The essential element in each seems to be the three prominent dots or
  circles. The day <b>Men</b> occurs very rarely on the monuments. The form
  shown in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>y</i>, is a grotesque head
  not unlike the sign for this day in the codices (fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>u</i>). The signs for the day <b>Cib</b> in the
  inscriptions and the codices (figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>z</i>,
  and <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>), respectively, are very
  dissimilar. Indeed, the form for <b>Cib</b> (fig. <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>v</i>) in the codices resembles more closely the
  sign for the day <b>Caban</b> (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a'</i>,
  <i>b'</i>) than it does the form for <b>Cib</b> in the inscriptions (see
  fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>z</i>). The only element common to both
  is the line paralleling the upper part of the glyph (*<img
  src="images/glyph40.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.57ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) and the short vertical lines connecting it with the outline at the
  top. The glyphs for the day <b>Caban</b> in both figures <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a'</i>, <i>b'</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>,
  <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, show a satisfactory resemblance to each other. The
  forms for the day <b>Eznab</b> are also practically identical (see figs.
  <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>c'</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>,
  <i>z</i>, <i>a'</i>). The forms for the day <b>Cauac</b>, on the other
  hand, are very dissimilar; compare figures <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>d'</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>b'</i>. The only point of
  resemblance between the two seems to be the element which appears in the
  eye of the former and at the lower left-hand side of the latter. The last
  of the twenty Maya days, and by <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>far the most important, since it is found in
  both the codices and the inscriptions more frequently than all of the
  others combined, is <b>Ahau</b> (see figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>e'-k'</i>, and <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>c'</i>, <i>d'</i>). The
  latter form is the only one found in the codices, and is identical with
  <i>e'</i>, <i>f'</i>, figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, the usual sign for
  this day in the inscriptions. The variants in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>g'-k</i>', appear on some of the monuments, and
  because of the great importance of this day <b>Ahau</b> it is necessary
  to keep all of them in mind.</p>

  <p>These examples of the glyphs, which stand for the twenty Maya days,
  are in each case as typical as possible. The student must remember,
  however, that many variations occur, which often render the correct
  identification of a form difficult. As explained in the preceding
  chapter, such variations are due not only to individual peculiarities of
  style, careless drawing, and actual error, but also to the physical
  dissimilarities of materials on which they are portrayed, as the stone of
  the monuments and the fiber paper of the codices; consequently, such
  differences may be regarded as unessential. The ability to identify
  variants differing from those shown in figures <a href="#fig16">16</a>
  and <a href="#fig17">17</a> will come only through experience and
  familiarity with the glyphs themselves. The student should constantly
  bear in mind, however, that almost every Maya glyph, the signs for the
  days included, has an <i>essential element</i> peculiar to it, and the
  discovery of such elements will greatly facilitate his study of Maya
  writing.</p>

  <p>Why the named days should have been limited to twenty is difficult to
  understand, as this number has no parallel period in nature. Some have
  conjectured that this number was chosen because it represents the number
  of man's digits, the twenty fingers and toes. Mr. Bowditch has pointed
  out in this connection that the Maya word for the period composed of
  these twenty named days is <i>uinal</i>, while the word for 'man' is
  <i>uinik</i>. The parallel is interesting and may possibly explain why
  the number twenty was selected as the basis of the Maya system of
  numeration, which, as we shall see later, was vigesimal, that is,
  increasing by twenties or multiples thereof.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">The Tonalamatl, or 260-day Period</span></p>

  <p>Merely calling a day by one of the twenty names given in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a>, however, did not sufficiently describe it according
  to the Maya notion. For instance, there was no day in the Maya calendar
  called merely <b>Imix</b>, <b>Ik</b>, or <b>Akbal</b>, or, in fact, by
  any of the other names given in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>. Before the
  name of a day was complete it was necessary to prefix to it a number
  ranging from 1 to 13, inclusive, as <b>6 Imix</b> or <b>13 Akbal</b>.
  Then and only then did a Maya day receive its complete designation and
  find its proper place in the calendar.</p>

  <p>The manner in which these thirteen numbers, 1 to 13, inclusive, were
  joined to the twenty names of Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> was as
  follows: Selecting <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>any one of the twenty names<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> as a starting point, <b>Kan</b> for
  example, the number 1 was prefixed to it. See Table <a
  href="#tableII">II</a>, in which the names of Table I have been repeated
  with the numbers prefixed to them in a manner to be explained hereafter.
  The star opposite the name <b>Kan</b> indicates the starting point above
  chosen. The name <b>Chicchan</b> immediately following <b>Kan</b> in
  Table <a href="#tableII">II</a> was given the next number in order (2),
  namely, <b>2 Chicchan</b>. The next name, <b>Cimi</b>, was given the next
  number (3), namely, <b>3 Cimi</b>, and so on as follows: <b>4 Manik</b>,
  <b>5 Lamat</b>, <b>6 Muluc</b>, <b>7 Oc</b>, <b>8 Chuen</b>, <b>9 Eb</b>,
  <b>10 Ben</b>, <b>11 Ix</b>, <b>12 Men</b>, <b>13 Cib</b>.</p>

  <p>Instead of giving to the next name in Table <a href="#tableII">II</a>
  (<b>Caban</b>) the number 14, the number 1 was prefixed; for, as
  previously stated, the numerical coefficients of the days did not rise
  above the number 13. Following the day <b>1 Caban,</b> the sequence
  continued as before: <b>2 Eznab</b>, <b>3 Cauac</b>, <b>4 Ahau</b>. After
  the day<b> 4 Ahau</b>, the last in Table <a href="#tableII">II</a>, the
  next number in order, in this case 5, was prefixed to the next name in
  order&mdash;that is, <b>Imix</b>, the first name in Table <a
  href="#tableII">II</a>&mdash;and the count continued without
  interruption: <b>5 Imix</b>, <b>6 Ik</b>, <b>7 Akbal</b>, or back to the
  name <b>Kan</b> with which it started. There was no break in the
  sequence, however, even at this point (or at any other, for that matter).
  The next name in Table <a href="#tableII">II</a>, <b>Kan</b>, selected
  for the starting point, was given the number next in order, i.&nbsp;e., 8, and
  the day following <b>7 Akbal</b> in Table <a href="#tableII">II</a> would
  be, therefore, <b>8 Kan</b>, and the sequence would continue to be formed
  in the same way: <b>8 Kan</b>, <b>9 Chicchan</b>, <b>10 Cimi</b>, <b>11
  Manik</b>, <b>12 Lamat</b>, <b>13 Muluc</b>, <b>1 Oc</b>, <b>2 Chuen</b>,
  <b>3 Eb</b>, and so on. So far as the Maya conception of time was
  concerned, this sequence of days went on without interruption,
  forever.</p>

  <p>While somewhat unusual at first sight, this sequence is in reality
  exceedingly simple, being governed by three easily remembered rules:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> The sequence of the 20 day names repeats itself again
  and again without interruption.</p>

<p><!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> The sequence of the numerical coefficients 1 to 13,
  inclusive, repeats itself again and again without interruption, 1
  following immediately 13.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 3.</i> The 13 numerical coefficients are attached to the 20
  names, so that after a start has been made by prefixing any one of the 13
  numbers to any one of the 20 names, the number next in order is given to
  the name next in order, and the sequence continues indefinitely in this
  manner.</p>

  <p>It is a simple question of arithmetic to determine the number of days
  which must elapse before a day bearing the same designation as a previous
  one in the sequence can reappear. Since there are 13 numbers and 20
  names, and since each of the 13 numbers must be attached in turn to each
  one of the 20 names before a given number can return to a given name, we
  must find the least common multiple of 13 and 20. As these two numbers,
  contain no common factor, their least common multiple is their product
  (260), which is the number sought. Therefore, any given day can not
  reappear in the sequence until after the 259 days immediately following
  it shall have elapsed. Or, in other words, the 261st day will have the
  same designation as the 1st, the 262d the same as the 2d, and so on.</p>

  <p>This is graphically shown in the wheel figured in plate <a
  href="#plate5">5</a>, where the sequence of the days, commencing with
  <b>1 Imix</b>, which is indicated by a star, is represented as extending
  around the rim of the wheel. After the name of each day, its number in
  the sequence beginning with the starting point <b>1 Imix</b>, is shown in
  parenthesis. Now, if the star opposite the day <b>1 Imix</b> be conceived
  to be stationary and the wheel to revolve in a sinistral circuit, that is
  contra-clockwise, the days will pass the star in the order which they
  occupy in the 260-day sequence. It appears from this diagram also that
  the day <b>1 Imix</b> can not recur until after 260 days shall have
  passed, and that it always follows the day <b>13 Ahau</b>. This must be
  true since <i>Ahau</i> is the name immediately preceding <b>Imix</b> in
  the sequence of the day names and 13 is the number immediately preceding
  1. After the day <b>13 Ahau</b> (the 260th from the starting point) is
  reached, the day <b>1 Imix</b>, the 261st, recurs and the sequence,
  having entered into itself again, begins anew as before.</p>

    the tonalamatl (according to Goodman).</p>
  </div>

  <p>This round of the 260 differently named days was called by the Aztec
  the <i>tonalamatl</i>, or "book of days." The Maya name for this period
  is unknown<a name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and students
  have accepted the Aztec name for it. The tonalamatl is frequently
  represented in the Maya codices, there being more than 200 examples in
  the Codex Tro-Cortesiano alone. It was a very useful period for the
  calculations of the priests because of the different sets of factors into
  which it can be resolved, <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>namely, 4×65, 5×52, 10×26, 13×20, and 2×130.
  Tonalamatls divided into 4, 5, and 10 equal parts of 65, 52, and 26 days,
  respectively, occur repeatedly throughout the codices.</p>

  <p>It is all the more curious, therefore, that this period is rarely
  represented in the inscriptions. The writer recalls but one city (Copan)
  in which this period is recorded to any considerable extent. It might
  almost be inferred from this fact alone that the inscriptions do not
  treat of prophecy, divinations, or ritualistic and ceremonial matters,
  since these subjects in the codices are always found in connection with
  tonalamatls. If true this considerably restricts the field of which the
  inscriptions may treat.</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman has identified the glyph shown in figure <a
  href="#fig18">18</a> as the sign for the 260-day period, but on wholly
  insufficient evidence the writer believes. On the other hand, so
  important a period as the tonalamatl undoubtedly had its own particular
  glyph, but up to the present time all efforts to identify this sign have
  proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">The Haab, or Year of 365 Days</span></p>

  <p>Having explained the composition and nature of the tonalamatl, or
  so-called Sacred Year, let us turn to the consideration of the Solar
  Year, which was known as <i>haab</i> in the Maya language.</p>

  <p>The Maya used in their calendar system a 365-day year, though they
  doubtless knew that the true length of the year exceeds this by 6 hours.
  Indeed, Bishop Landa very explicitly states that such knowledge was
  current among them. "They had," he says, "their perfect year, like ours,
  of 365 days and 6 hours;" and again, "The entire year had 18 of these
  [20-day periods] and besides 5 days and 6 hours." In spite of Landa's
  statements, however, it is equally clear that had the Maya attempted to
  take note of these 6 additional hours by inserting an extra day in their
  calendar every fourth year, their day sequence would have been disturbed
  at once. An examination of the tonalamatl, or round of days (see pl. <a
  href="#plate5">5</a>), shows also that the interpolation of a single day
  at any point would have thrown into confusion the whole Maya calendar,
  not only interfering with the sequence but also destroying its power of
  reentering itself at the end of 260 days. The explanation of this
  statement is found in the fact that the Maya calendar had no elastic
  period corresponding to our month of February, which is increased in
  length whenever the accumulation of fractional days necessitates the
  addition of an extra day, in order to keep the calendar year from gaining
  on the true year.</p>

  <p>If the student can be made to realize that all Maya periods, from the
  lowest to the highest known, are always in a continuous sequence, <!--
  Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span>each
  returning into itself and beginning anew after completion, he will have
  grasped the most fundamental principle of Maya chronology&mdash;its
  absolute continuity throughout.</p>

  <p>It may be taken for granted, therefore, in the discussion to follow
  that no interpolation of intercalary days was actually made. It is
  equally probable, however, that the priests, in whose hands such matters
  rested, corrected the calendar by additional calculations which showed
  just how many days the recorded year was ahead of the true year at any
  given time. Mr. Bowditch (1910: Chap. <span class="sm">XI</span>) has
  cited several cases in which such additional calculations exactly correct
  the inscriptions on the monument upon which they appear and bring their
  dates into harmony with the true solar year.</p>

  <p>So far as the calendar is concerned, then, the year consisted of but
  365 days. It was divided into 18 periods of 20 days each, designated in
  Maya <i>uinal</i>, and a closing period of 5 days known as the <i>xma
  kaba kin</i>, or "days without name." The sum of these (18×20+5) exactly
  made up the calendar year.</p>

  <p>The names of these 19 divisions of the year are given in Table <a
  href="#tableIII">III</a> in the order in which they follow one another;
  the twentieth day of one month was succeeded by the first day of the next
  month.</p>

  <p>The first day of the Maya year was the first day of the month
  <b>Pop</b>, which, according to the early Spanish authorities, Bishop
  Landa (1864: p. 276) included, always fell on the 16th of July.<a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> <b>Uayeb</b>, the last
  division of the year, contained only 5 days, the last day of <b>Uayeb</b>
  being at the same time the 365th day of the year. Consequently, when this
  day was completed, the next in order was the Maya New Year's Day, the
  first day of the month <b>Pop</b>, after which the sequence repeated
  itself as before.</p>

  <p>The xma kaba kin, or "days without name," were regarded as especially
  unlucky and ill-omened. Says Pio Perez (see Landa, 1864: p. 384) in
  speaking of these closing days of the year: "Some call them <i>u yail
  kin</i> or <i>u yail haab</i>, which may be translated, the sorrowful and
  laborious days or part of the year; for they [the Maya] <!-- Page 46
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>believed that in
  them occurred sudden deaths and pestilences, and that they were diseased
  by poisonous animals, or devoured by wild beasts, fearing that if they
  went out to the field to their labors, some tree would pierce them or
  some other kind of misfortune happen to them." The Aztec held the five
  closing days of the year in the same superstitious dread. Persons born in
  this unlucky period were held to be destined by this fact to wretchedness
  and poverty for life. These days were, moreover, prophetic in character;
  what occurred during them continued to happen ever afterward. Hence,
  quarreling was avoided during this period lest it should never cease.</p>

  <p>Having learned the number, length, and names of the several periods
  into which the Maya divided their year, and the sequence in which these
  followed one another, the next subject which claims attention is the
  positions of the several days in these periods. In order properly to
  present this important subject, it is first necessary to consider briefly
  how we count and number our own units of time, since through an
  understanding of these practices we shall better comprehend those of the
  ancient Maya.</p>

  <p>It is well known that our methods of counting time are inconsistent
  with each other. For example, in describing the time of day, that is, in
  counting hours, minutes, and seconds, we speak in terms of elapsed time.
  When we say it is 1 o'clock, in reality the first hour after noon, that
  is, the hour between 12 noon and 1 p. m., has passed and the second hour
  after noon is about to commence. When we say it is 2 o'clock, in reality
  the second hour after noon is finished and the third hour about to
  commence. In other words, we count the time of day by referring to passed
  periods and not current periods. This is the method used in reckoning
  astronomical time. During the passage of the first hour after midnight
  the hours are said to be zero, the time being counted by the number of
  minutes and seconds elapsed. Thus, half past 12 is written:
  0<sup>hr.</sup> 30<sup>min.</sup> 0<sup>sec.</sup>, and quarter of 1,
  0<sup>hr.</sup> 45<sup>min.</sup> 0<sup>sec.</sup>. Indeed one hour can
  not be written until the first hour after midnight is completed, or until
  it is 1 o'clock, namely, 1<sup>hr.</sup> 0<sup>min.</sup>
  0<sup>sec.</sup>.</p>

  <p>We use an entirely different method, however, in counting our days,
  years, and centuries, which are referred to as current periods of time.
  It is the 1st day of January immediately after midnight December 31. It
  was the first year of the Eleventh Century immediately after midnight
  December 31, 1000 A.&nbsp;D. And finally, it was the Twentieth Century
  immediately after midnight December 31, 1900 A.&nbsp;D. In this category
  should be included also the days of the week and the months, since the
  names of these periods also refer to present time. In other words when we
  speak of our days, months, years, and centuries, we do not have in mind,
  and do not refer to completed periods of time, but on the contrary to
  current periods. <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>{47}</span></p>

  <p>It will be seen that in the first method of counting time, in speaking
  of 1 o'clock, 1 hour, 30 minutes, we use only the cardinal forms of our
  numbers; but in the second method we say the 1st of January, the
  Twentieth Century, using the ordinal forms, though even here we permit
  ourselves one inconsistency. In speaking of our years, which are reckoned
  by the second method, we say "nineteen hundred and twelve," when, to be
  consistent, we should say "nineteen hundred and twelfth," using the
  ordinal "twelfth" instead of the cardinal "twelve."</p>

  <p>We may then summarize our methods of counting time as follows: (1) All
  periods less than the day, as hours, minutes, and seconds, are referred
  to in terms of past time; and (2) the day and all greater periods are
  referred to in terms of current time.</p>

  <p>The Maya seem to have used only the former of these two methods in
  counting time; that is, all the different periods recorded in the codices
  and the inscriptions seemingly refer to elapsed time rather than to
  current time, to a day passed, rather than to a day present. Strange as
  this may appear to us, who speak of our calendar as current time, it is
  probably true nevertheless that the Maya, in so far as their writing is
  concerned, never designated a present day but always treated of a day
  gone by. The day recorded is yesterday because to-day can not be
  considered an entity until, like the hour of astronomical time, it
  completes itself and becomes a unit, that is, a yesterday.</p>

  <p>This is well illustrated by the Maya method of numbering the positions
  of the days in the months, which, as we shall see, was identical with our
  own method of counting astronomical time. For example, the first day of
  the Maya month <b>Pop</b> was written <b>Zero Pop</b>, (<b>0 Pop</b>) for
  not until one whole day of <b>Pop</b> had passed could the day <b>1
  Pop</b> be written; by that time, however, the first day of the month had
  passed and the second day commenced. In other words, the second day of
  <b>Pop</b> was written <b>1 Pop</b>; the third day, <b>2 Pop</b>; the
  fourth day, <b>3 Pop</b>; and so on through the 20 days of the Maya
  month. This method of numbering the positions of the days in the month
  led to calling the last day of a month 19 instead of 20. This appears in
  Table <a href="#tableIV">IV</a>, in which the last 6 days of one year and
  the first 22 of the next year are referred to their corresponding
  positions in the divisions of the Maya year. It must be remembered in
  using this Table that the closing period of the Maya year, the xma kaba
  kin, or <b>Uayeb</b>, contained only 5 days, whereas all the other
  periods (the 18 uinals) had 20 days each.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough no glyph for the <i>haab</i>, or year, has been
  identified as yet, in spite of the apparent importance of this period.<a
  name="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> The <!-- Page 48 --><span

  <p>The signs for the first four months, <b>Pop</b>, <b>Uo</b>,
  <b>Zip</b>, and <b>Zotz</b>, show a convincing similarity in both the
  inscriptions and the codices. The essential elements of <b>Pop</b> (figs.
  <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>a</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>a</i>)
  are the crossed bands and the <i>kin</i> sign. The latter is found in
  both the forms figured, though only a part of the former appears in
  figure <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>a</i>. <b>Uo</b> has two forms in the
  inscriptions (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>),<a
  name="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> which are, however, very
  similar to each other as well as to the corresponding forms in the
  codices (fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>). The glyphs
  for the month <b>Zip</b> are identical in both figures <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>d</i>.
  The grotesque heads for <b>Zotz</b> in figures <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>,<a name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and
  <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>e</i>, are also similar to each other. The
  essential <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>characteristic seems to be the prominent
  upturned and flaring nose. The forms for <b>Tzec</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>f</i>) show only a very general similarity, and those for <b>Xul</b>,
  the next month, are even more unlike. The only sign for <b>Xul</b> in the
  inscriptions (fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) bears
  very little resemblance to the common form for this month in the codices
  (fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>g</i>), though it is not unlike the
  variant in <i>h</i>, figure <a href="#fig20">20</a>. The essential
  characteristic seems to be the familiar ear and the small mouth, shown in
  the inscription as an oval and in the codices as a hook surrounded with
  dots.</p>

    signs in the codices.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The sign for the month <b>Yaxkin</b> is identical in both figures <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>. The sign for the month <b>Mol</b> in figures <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>k</i> exhibits the same close similarity. The forms for the month
  <b>Chen</b> in figures <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, and
  20, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, on the other hand, bear only a slight resemblance
  to each other. The forms for the months <b>Yax</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>n</i>), <b>Zac</b> (figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>,
  and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>o</i>), and <b>Ceh</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, and <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span><a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>p</i>) are again identical in each case. The signs for the next month,
  <b>Mac</b>, however, are entirely dissimilar, the form commonly found in
  the inscriptions (fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>w</i>) bearing
  absolutely no resemblance to that shown in figure <a
  href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, the only form for this month in
  the codices. The very unusual variant (fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  <i>x</i>), from Stela 25 at Piedras Negras is perhaps a trifle nearer the
  form found in the codices. The flattened oval in the main part of the
  variant is somewhat like the upper part of the glyph in figure <a
  href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>q</i>. The essential element of the glyph for
  the month <b>Mac</b>, so far as the inscriptions are concerned, is the
  element (*<img src="images/glyph51.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.71ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) found as the superfix in both <i>w</i> and <i>x</i>, figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>. The sign for the month <b>Kankin</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>) and the signs for the month <b>Muan</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>a'</i>, <i>b'</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) show only a general similarity. The signs for the
  last three months of the year, <b>Pax</b> (figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  <i>c'</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>w</i>), <b>Kayab</b> (figs. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>), and <b>Cumhu</b> (figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  <i>g'</i>, <i>h'</i>, and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>z</i>, <i>a'</i>,
  <i>b'</i>) in the inscriptions and codices, respectively, are practically
  identical. The closing division of the year, the five days of the xma
  kaba kin, called <b>Uayeb</b>, is represented by essentially the same
  glyph in both the inscriptions and the codices. Compare figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>i'</i>, with figure <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>c'</i>.</p>

  <p>It will be seen from the foregoing comparison that on the whole the
  glyphs for the months in the inscriptions are similar to the
  corresponding forms in the codices, and that such variations as are found
  may readily be accounted for by the fact that the codices and the
  inscriptions probably not only emanate from different parts of the Maya
  territory but also date from different periods.</p>

  <p>The student who wishes to decipher Maya writing is strongly urged to
  memorize the signs for the days and months given in figures <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, since his progress will depend largely on
  his ability to recognize these glyphs when he encounters them in the
  texts.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">The Calendar Round, or 18980-day Period</span></p>

  <p>Before taking up the study of the Calendar Round let us briefly
  summarize the principal points ascertained in the preceding pages
  concerning the Maya method of counting time. In the first place we
  learned from the tonalamatl (pl. <a href="#plate5">5</a>) three things:
  (1) The number of differently named days; (2) the names of these days;
  (3) the order in which they invariably followed one another. And in the
  second place we learned in the discussion of the Maya year, or haab, just
  concluded, four other things: (1) The length of the year; (2) the number,
  length, and names of the several periods into which it was divided; (3)
  the order in which these periods invariably followed one another; (4) the
  positions of the days in these periods.</p>

  <p>The proper combination of these two, the tonalamatl, or "round of
  days," and the haab, or year of uinals, and the xma kaba kin, formed the
  Calendar Round, to which the tonalamatl contributed the names <!-- Page
  52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>of the days
  and the haab the positions of these days in the divisions of the year.
  The <i>Calendar Round</i> was the most important period in Maya
  chronology, and a comprehension of its nature and of the principles which
  governed its composition is therefore absolutely essential to the
  understanding of the Maya system of counting time.</p>

  <p>It has been explained (see p. <a href="#page41">41</a>) that the
  complete designation or name of any day in the tonalamatl consisted of
  two equally essential parts: (1) The name glyph, and (2) the numerical
  coefficient. Disregarding the latter for the present, let us first see
  <i>which</i> of the twenty names in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, that
  is, the name parts of the days, can stand at the beginning of the Maya
  year.</p>

  <p>In applying any sequence of names or numbers to another there are only
  three possibilities concerning the names or numbers which can stand at
  the head of the resulting sequence:</p>

  <p>1. When the sums of the units in each of the two sequences contain no
  common factor, each one of the units in turn will stand at the head of
  the resulting sequence.</p>

  <p>2. When the sum of the units in one of the two sequences is a multiple
  of the sum of the units in the other, only the first unit can stand at
  the head of the resulting sequence.</p>

  <p>3. When the sums of the units in the two sequences contain a common
  factor (except in those cases which fall under (2), that is, in which one
  is a multiple of the other) only certain units can stand at the head of
  the sequence.</p>

  <p>Now, since our two numbers (the 20 names in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a> and the 365 days of the year) contain a common
  factor, and since neither is a multiple of the other, it is clear that
  only the last of the three contingencies just mentioned concerns us here;
  and we may therefore dismiss the first two from further
  consideration.</p>

  <p>The Maya year, then, could begin only with certain of the days in
  Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, and the next task is to find out which of
  these twenty names invariably stood at the beginnings of the years.</p>

  <p>When there is a sequence of 20 names in endless repetition, it is
  evident that the 361st will be the same as the 1st, since 360 = 20 × 18.
  Therefore the 362d will be the same as the 2d, the 363d as the 3d, the
  364th as the 4th, and the 365 as the 5th. But the 365th, or 5th, name is
  the name of the last day of the year, consequently the 1st day of the
  following year (the 366th from the beginning) will have the 6th name in
  the sequence. Following out this same idea, it appears that the 361st day
  of the <i>second year</i> will have the same name as that with which it
  began, that is, the 6th name in the sequence, the 362d day the 7th name,
  the 363d the 8th, the 364th the 9th, and the 365th, or last day of the
  <i>second year</i>, the 10th name. Therefore the 1st day of the <i>third
  year</i> (the 731st from the beginning) will have the 11th name in the
  sequence. Similarly it could be shown <!-- Page 53 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>that the <i>third
  year</i>, beginning with the 11th name, would necessarily end with the
  15th name; and the <i>fourth year</i>, beginning with the 16th name (the
  1096th from the beginning) would necessarily end with the 20th, or last
  name, in the sequence. It results, therefore, from the foregoing
  progression that the <i>fifth year</i> will have to begin with the 1st
  name (the 1461st from the beginning), or the same name with which the
  <i>first year</i> also began.</p>

  <p>This is capable of mathematical proof, since the 1st day of the
  <i>fifth year</i> has the 1461st name from the beginning of the sequence,
  for 1461 = 4×365+1 = 73×20+1. The <i>1</i> in the second term of this
  equation indicates that the beginning day of the <i>fifth year</i> has
  been reached; and the <i>1</i> in the third term indicates that the
  name-part of this day is the 1st name in the sequence of twenty. In other
  words, every fifth year began with a day, the name part of which was the
  same, and consequently only four of the names in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a> could stand at the beginnings of the Maya years.</p>

  <p>The four names which successively occupied this, the most important
  position of the year, were: <b>Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban</b> (see Table <a
  href="#tableV">V</a>, in which these four names are shown in their
  relation to the sequence of twenty). Beginning with any one of these,
  <b>Ik</b> for example, the next in order, <b>Manik</b>, is 5 days
  distant, the next, <b>Eb</b>, another five days, the next, <b>Caban</b>,
  another 5 days, and the next, <b>Ik</b>, the name with which the Table
  started, another 5 days.</p>

  <p>Since one of the four names just given invariably began the Maya year,
  it follows that in any given year, all of its nineteen divisions, the 18
  uinals and the xma kaba kin, also began with the same name, which was the
  name of the first day of the first uinal. This is necessarily true
  because these 19 divisions of the year, with the exception of the last,
  each contained 20 days, and consequently the name of the first day of the
  first division determined the names of the first days of all the
  succeeding divisions of that particular year. Furthermore, since the xma
  kaba kin, the closing division of the year, contained but 5 days, the
  name of the first day of the following year; as well as <!-- Page 54
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>the names of the
  first days of all of its divisions, was shifted forward in the sequence
  another 5 days, as shown above.</p>

  <p>This leads directly to another important conclusion: Since the first
  days of all the divisions of any given year always had the same
  name-part, it follows that the second days of all the divisions of that
  year had the same name, that is, the next succeeding in the sequence of
  twenty. The third days in each division of that year must have had the
  same name, the fourth days the same name, and so on, throughout the 20
  days of the month. For example, if a year began with the day-name
  <b>Ik</b>, all of the divisions in that year also began with the same
  name, and the second days of all its divisions had the day-name
  <b>Akbal</b>, the third days the name <b>Kan</b>, the fourth days the
  name <b>Chicchan</b>, and so forth. This enables us to formulate the
  following&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="under"><i>Rule.</i></span> The 20 day-names always occupy
  the same positions in all the divisions of any given year.</p>

  <p>But since the year and its divisions must begin with one of four
  names, it is clear that the second positions also must be filled with one
  of another group of four names, and the third positions with one of
  another group of four names, and so on, through all the positions of the
  month. This enables us to formulate a second&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="under"><i>Rule.</i></span> Only four of the twenty
  day-names can ever occupy any given position in the divisions of the
  years.</p>

  <p>But since, in the years when <b>Ik</b> is the 1st name, <b>Manik</b>
  will be the 6th, <b>Eb</b> the 11th, and <b>Caban</b> the 16th, and in
  the years when <b>Manik</b> is the 1st, <b>Eb</b> will be the 6th,
  <b>Caban</b> the 11th, and <b>Ik</b> the 16th, and in the years when
  <b>Eb</b> is the 1st, <b>Caban</b> will be the 6th, <b>Ik</b> the 11th,
  and <b>Manik</b> the 16th, and in the years when <b>Caban</b> is the 1st,
  <b>Ik</b> will be the 6th, <b>Manik</b> the 11th, and <b>Eb</b> the 16th,
  it is clear that any one of this group which begins the year may occupy
  also three other positions in the divisions of the year, these positions
  being 5 days distant from each other. Consequently, it follows that
  <b>Akbal, Lamat, Ben</b>, and <b>Eznab</b> in Table <a
  href="#tableV">V</a>, the names which occupy the second positions in the
  divisions of the year, will fill the 7th, 12th, and 17th positions as
  well. Similarly <b>Kan, Muluc, Ix</b>, and <b>Cauac</b> will fill the 3d,
  8th, 13th, and 18th positions, and so on. This enables us to formulate a
  third&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="under"><i>Rule.</i></span> The 20 day-names are divided
  into five groups of four names each, any name in any group being five
  days distant from the name next preceding it in the same group, and
  furthermore, the names of any one group will occupy four different
  positions in the divisions of successive years, these positions being
  five days apart in each case. This is expressed in Table <a
  href="#tableVI">VI</a>, in which these groups are shown as well as the
  positions in the divisions of the years which the names of each group may
  occupy. A comparison with Table <a href="#tableV">V</a> will demonstrate
  that this arrangement is inevitable. <!-- Page 55 --><span

  <p>But we have seen on page <a href="#page47">47</a> and in Table <a
  href="#tableIV">IV</a> that the Maya did not designate the first days of
  the several divisions of the years according to our system. It was shown
  there that the first day of <b>Pop</b> was not written <b>1 Pop</b>, but
  <b>0 Pop</b>, and similarly the second day of Pop was written not <b>2
  Pop</b>, but <b>1 Pop</b>, and the last day, not <b>20 Pop</b>, but <b>19
  Pop</b>. Consequently, before we can use the names in Table <a
  href="#tableVI">VI</a> as the Maya used them, we must make this shift,
  keeping in mind, however, that <b>Ik</b>, <b>Manik</b>, <b>Eb</b>, and
  <b>Caban</b> (the only four of the twenty names which could begin the
  year and which were written <b>0 Pop</b>, <b>5 Pop</b>, <b>10 Pop</b>, or
  <b>15 Pop</b>) would be written in our notation <b>1st Pop</b>, <b>6th
  Pop</b>, <b>11th Pop</b>, and <b>16th Pop</b>, respectively. This
  difference, as has been previously explained, results from the Maya
  method of counting time by elapsed periods.</p>

  <p>Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a> shows the positions of the days in
  the divisions of the year according to the Maya conception, that is, with
  the shift in the month coefficient made necessary by this practice of
  recording their days as elapsed time.</p>

  <p>The student will find Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a> very useful in
  deciphering the texts, since it shows at a glance the only positions
  which any given day can occupy in the divisions of the year. Therefore
  when the sign for a day has been recognized in the texts, from Table <a
  href="#tableVII">VII</a> can be ascertained the only four positions which
  this day can hold in the month, thus reducing the number of possible
  month coefficients for which search need be made, from twenty to
  four.</p>

  <p>Now let us summarize the points which we have successively established
  as resulting from the combination of the tonalamatl and haab, remembering
  always that as yet we have been dealing only with <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span><i>the name parts of the
  days and not their complete designations</i>. Bearing this in mind, we
  may state the following facts concerning the 20 day-names and their
  positions in the divisions of the year:</p>

  <p>1. The Maya year and its several divisions could begin only with one
  of these four day-names: <b>Ik</b>, <b>Manik</b>, <b>Eb</b>, and
  <b>Caban</b>.</p>

  <p>2. Consequently, any particular position in the divisions of the year
  could be occupied only by one of four day-names.</p>

  <p>3. Consequently, every fifth year any particular day-name returned to
  the same position in the divisions of the year.</p>

  <p>4. Consequently, any particular day-name could occupy only one of four
  positions in the divisions of the year, each of which it held in
  successive years, returning to the same position every fifth year.</p>

  <p>5. Consequently, the twenty day-names were divided into five groups of
  four day-names each, any day-name of any group being five days distant
  from the day-name of the same group next preceding it.</p>

  <p>6. Finally, in any given year any particular day-name occupied the
  same relative position throughout the divisions of that year.</p>

  <p>Up to this point, however, as above stated, we have not been dealing
  with the complete designations of the Maya days, but only their <i>name
  parts</i> or name glyphs, the positions of which in the several divisions
  of the year we have ascertained.</p>

  <p>It now remains to join the tonalamatl, which gives the complete names
  of the 260 Maya days, to the haab, which gives the positions of the days
  in the divisions of the year, in such a way that any one of the days
  whose name-part is <b>Ik</b>, <b>Manik</b>, <b>Eb</b>, or <b>Caban</b>
  shall occupy the first position of the first division of the year; that
  is, <b>0 Pop</b>, or, as we should write it, the first day of <b>Pop</b>.
  It matters little which one of these four name parts we choose first,
  since in four years each one of them in succession will have appeared in
  the position <b>0 Pop</b>.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the easiest way to visualize the combination of the tonalamatl
  and the haab is to conceive these two periods as two cogwheels revolving
  in contact with each other. Let us imagine that the first of these,
  <b>A</b> (fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>), has 260 teeth, or cogs, each one
  of which is named after one of the 260 days of the tonalamatl and follows
  the sequence shown in plate <a href="#plate5">5</a>. The second wheel,
  <b>B</b> (fig. <a href="#fig21">21</a>), is somewhat larger, having 365
  cogs. Each of the spaces or sockets between these represents one of the
  365 positions of the days in the divisions of the year, beginning with
  <b>0 Pop</b> and ending with <b>4 Uayeb</b>. See Table <a
  href="#tableIV">IV</a> for the positions of the days at the end of one
  year and the commencement of the next. Finally, let us imagine that these
  two wheels are brought into contact with each other in such a way that
  the tooth or cog named <b>2 Ik</b> in <b>A</b> shall fit into the socket
  named <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span><b>0 Pop</b> in <b>B</b>, after which both
  wheels start to revolve in the directions indicated by the arrows.</p>

  <p>The first day of the year whose beginning is shown at the point of
  contact of the two wheels in figure <a href="#fig21">21</a> is <b>2 Ik 0
  Pop</b>, that is, the day <b>2 Ik</b> which occupies the first position
  in the month <b>Pop</b>. The next day in succession will be <b>3 Akbal 1
  Pop</b>, the next <b>4 Kan 2 Pop</b>, the next <b>5 Chicchan 3 Pop</b>,
  the next <b>6 Cimi 4 Pop</b>, and so on. As the wheels revolve in the
  directions indicated, the days of the tonalamatl successively fall into
  their appropriate positions in the divisions of the year. Since the
  number of cogs in A is smaller than the number in B, it is clear that the
  former will have returned to its starting point, <b>2 Ik</b> (that is,
  made one complete revolution), before the latter will have made one
  complete revolution; and, further, that when the latter (B) has returned
  to its starting point, <b>0 Pop</b>, the corresponding cog in B will not
  be <b>2 Ik</b>, but another day (<b>3 Manik</b>), since by that time the
  smaller wheel will have progressed 105 cogs, or days, farther, to the cog
  <b>3 Manik</b>.</p>

  <p>The question now arises, how many revolutions will each wheel have to
  make before the day <b>2 Ik</b> will return to the position <b>0 Pop</b>.
  The solution of this problem depends on the application of one sequence
  to another, and the possibilities concerning the numbers or names which
  stand at the head of the resulting sequence, a subject already discussed
  on page <a href="#page52">52</a>. In the present case the numbers in
  question, 260 and 365, contain a common factor, therefore our problem
  falls under the third contingency there presented. Consequently, only
  certain of the 260 days can occupy the position <b>0 Pop</b>, or, in
  other words, cog <b>2 Ik</b> in A will return to the position <b>0
  Pop</b> in B in fewer than 260 revolutions of A. The actual solution of
  the problem <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>is a simple question of arithmetic. Since
  the day <b>2 Ik</b> can not return to its original position in A until
  after 260 days shall have passed, and since the day <b>0 Pop</b> can not
  return to its original position in B until after 365 days shall have
  passed, it is clear that the day <b>2 Ik 0 Pop</b> can not recur until
  after a number of days shall have passed equal to the least common
  multiple of these numbers, which is (260/5)×(365/5)×5, or 52×73×5 =
  18,980 days. But 18,980 days = 52×365 = 73×260; in other words the day
  <b>2 Ik 0 Pop</b> can not recur until after 52 revolutions of B, or 52
  years of 365 days each, and 73 revolutions of A, or 73 tonalamatls of 260
  days each. The Maya name for this 52-year period is unknown; it has been
  called the Calendar Round by modern students because it was only after
  this interval of time had elapsed that any given day could return to the
  same position in the year. The Aztec name for this period was
  <i>xiuhmolpilli</i> or <i>toxiuhmolpia</i>.<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Calendar Round was the real basis of Maya chronology, since its
  18,980 dates included all the possible combinations of the 260 days with
  the 365 positions of the year. Although the Maya developed a much more
  elaborate system of counting time, wherein any date of the Calendar Round
  could be fixed with absolute certainty within a period of 374,400 years,
  this truly remarkable feat was accomplished only by using a sequence of
  Calendar Rounds, or 52-year periods, in endless repetition from a fixed
  point of departure.</p>

  <p>In the development of their chronological system the Aztec probably
  never progressed beyond the Calendar Round. At least no greater period of
  time than the round of 52 years has been found in their texts. The
  failure of the Aztec to develop some device which would distinguish any
  given day in one Calendar Round from a day of the same name in another
  has led to hopeless confusion in regard to various events of their
  history. Since the same date occurred at intervals of every 52 years, it
  is often difficult to determine the particular Calendar Round to which
  any given date with its corresponding event is to be referred;
  consequently, the true sequence of events in Aztec history still remains
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>Professor Seler says in this connection:<a name="NtA_35"
  href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>Anyone who has ever taken the trouble to collect the dates in old
  Mexican history from the various sources must speedily have discovered
  that the chronology is very much awry, that it is almost hopeless to look
  for an exact chronology. The date of the fall of Mexico is definitely
  fixed according to both the Indian and the Christian chronology ... but
  in regard to all that precedes this date, even to events tolerably near
  the time of the Spanish conquest, the statements differ widely.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span></p>

  <p>Such confusion indeed is only to be expected from a system of counting
  time and recording events which was so loose as to permit the occurrence
  of the same date twice, or even thrice, within the span of a single life;
  and when a system so inexact was used to regulate the lapse of any
  considerable number of years, the possibilities for error and
  misunderstanding are infinite. Thus it was with Aztec chronology.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, by conceiving the Calendar Rounds to be in endless
  repetition from a fixed point of departure, and measuring time by an
  accurate system, the Maya were able to secure precision in dating their
  events which is not surpassed even by our own system of counting
  time.</p>

    the Calendar Round: <i>a</i>, According to Goodman; <i>b</i>, according
    to Förstemann.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The glyph which stood for the Calendar Round has not been determined
  with any degree of certainty. Mr. Goodman believes the form shown in
  figure <a href="#fig22">22</a>, <i>a</i>, to be the sign for this period,
  while Professor Förstemann is equally sure that the form represented by
  <i>b</i> of this figure expressed the same idea. This difference of
  opinion between two authorities so eminent well illustrates the
  prevailing doubt as to just what glyph actually represented the 52-year
  period among the Maya. The sign in figure <a href="#fig22">22</a>,
  <i>a</i>, as the writer will endeavor to show later, is in all
  probability the sign for the great cycle.</p>

  <p>As will be seen in the discussion of the Long Count, the Maya,
  although they conceived time to be an endless succession of Calendar
  Rounds, did not reckon its passage by the lapse of successive Calendar
  Rounds; consequently, the need for a distinctive glyph which should
  represent this period was not acute. The contribution of the Calendar
  Round to Maya chronology was its 18,980 dates, and the glyphs which
  composed these are found repeatedly in both the codices and the
  inscriptions (see figs. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <a href="#fig17">17</a>,
  <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <a href="#fig20">20</a>). No signs have been
  found as yet, however, for either the haab or the tonalamatl, probably
  because, like the Calendar Round, these periods were not used as units in
  recording long stretches of time.</p>

  <p>It will greatly aid the student in his comprehension of the discussion
  to follow if he will constantly bear in mind the fact that one Calendar
  Round followed another without interruption or the interpolation of a
  single day; and further, that the Calendar Round may be likened to a
  large cogwheel having 18,980 teeth, each one of which represented one of
  the dates of this period, and that this wheel revolved forever, each cog
  passing a fixed point once every 52 years. <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">The Long Count</span></p>

  <p>We have seen:</p>

  <p>1. How the Maya distinguished 1 day from the 259 others in the
  tonalamatl;</p>

  <p>2. How they distinguished the position of 1 day from the 364 others in
  the haab, or year; and, finally,</p>

  <p>3. How by combining (1) and (2) they distinguished 1 day from the
  other 18,979 of the Calendar Round.</p>

  <p>It remains to explain how the Maya insured absolute accuracy in fixing
  a day within a period of 374,400 years, as stated above, or how they
  distinguished 1 day from 136,655,999 others.</p>

  <p>The Calendar Round, as we have seen, determined the position of a
  given day within a period of only 52 years. Consequently, in order to
  prevent confusion of days of the same name in successive Calendar Rounds
  or, in other words, to secure absolute accuracy in dating events, it was
  necessary to use additional data in the description of any date.</p>

  <p>In nearly all systems of chronology that presume to deal with really
  long periods the reckoning of years proceeds from fixed starting points.
  Thus in Christian chronology the starting point is the Birth of Christ,
  and our years are reckoned as B.&nbsp;C. or A.&nbsp;D. according as they precede or
  follow this event. The Greeks reckoned time from the earliest Olympic
  Festival of which the winner's name was known, that is, the games held in
  776 B.&nbsp;C., which were won by a certain Coroebus. The Romans took as their
  starting point the supposed date of the foundation of Rome, 753 B.&nbsp;C. The
  Babylonians counted time as beginning with the Era of Nabonassar, 747
  B.&nbsp;C. The death of Alexander the Great, in 325 B.&nbsp;C., ushered in the Era
  of Alexander. With the occupation of Babylon in 311 B.&nbsp;C. by Seleucus
  Nicator began the so-called Era of Seleucidæ. The conquest of Spain by
  Augustus Cæsar in 38 B.&nbsp;C. marked the beginning of a chronology which
  endured for more than fourteen centuries. The Mohammedans selected as
  their starting point the flight of their prophet Mohammed from Mecca in
  622 A.&nbsp;D., and events in this chronology are described as having occurred
  so many years after the Hegira (The Flight). The Persian Era began with
  the date 632 A.&nbsp;D., in which year Yezdegird III ascended the throne of
  Persia.</p>

  <p>It will be noted that each of the above-named systems of chronology
  has for its starting point some actual historic event, the occurrence, if
  not the date of which, is indubitable. Some chronologies, however,
  commence with an event of an altogether different character, the date of
  which from its very nature must always remain hypothetical. In this class
  should be mentioned such chronologies as reckon time from the Creation of
  the World. For example, the Era of Constantinople, the chronological
  system used in the Greek Church, <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>commences with that event, supposed to have
  occurred in 5509 B.&nbsp;C. The Jews reckoned the same event as having taken
  place in 3761 B.&nbsp;C. and begin the counting of time from this point. A
  more familiar chronology, having for its starting point the Creation of
  the World, is that of Archbishop Usher, in the Old Testament, which
  assigns this event to the year 4004 B.&nbsp;C.</p>

  <p>In common with these other civilized peoples of antiquity the ancient
  Maya had realized in the development of their chronological system the
  need for a fixed starting point, from which all subsequent events could
  be reckoned, and for this purpose they selected one of the dates of their
  Calendar Round. This was a certain date, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>,<a
  name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> that is, a day named <b>4
  Ahau</b>, which occupied the 9th position in the month <b>Cumhu</b>, the
  next to last division of the Maya year (see Table <a
  href="#tableIII">III</a>).</p>

  <p>While the nature of the event which took place on this date<a
  name="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> is unknown, its selection
  as the point from which time was subsequently reckoned alone indicates
  that it must have been of exceedingly great importance to the native
  mind. In attempting to approximate its real character, however, we are
  not without some assistance from the codices and the inscriptions. For
  instance, it is clear that all Maya dates which it is possible to regard
  as contemporaneous<a name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
  refer to a time fully 3,000 years later than the starting point (<b>4
  Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>) from which each is reckoned. In other words, Maya
  history is a blank for more than 3,000 years after the initial date of
  the Maya chronological system, during which time no events were
  recorded.</p>

  <p>This interesting condition strongly suggests that the starting point
  of Maya chronology was not an actual historical event, as the founding of
  Rome, the death of Alexander, the birth of Christ, or the flight of
  Mohammed from Mecca, but that on the contrary it was a purely
  hypothetical occurrence, as the Creation of the World or the birth of the
  gods; and further, that the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> was not chosen as
  the starting point until long after the time it designates. This, or some
  similar assumption, is necessary to account satisfactorily for the
  observed facts:</p>

  <p>1. That, as stated, after the starting point of Maya chronology there
  is a silence of more than 3,000 years, unbroken by a single
  contemporaneous record, and <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span></p>

  <p>2. That after this long period had elapsed all the dated monuments<a
  name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> had their origin in the
  comparatively short period of four centuries.</p>

  <p>Consequently, it is safe to conclude that no matter what the Maya may
  have believed took place on this date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, in reality
  when this day was present time they had not developed their distinctive
  civilization or even achieved a social organization.</p>

  <p>It is clear from the foregoing that in addition to the Calendar Round,
  the Maya made use of a fixed starting point in describing their dates.
  The next question is, Did they record the lapse of more than 3,000 years
  simply by using so unwieldy a unit as the 52-year period or its
  multiples? A numerical system based on 52 as its primary unit immediately
  gives rise to exceedingly awkward numbers for its higher terms; that is,
  52, 104, 156, 208, 260, 312, etc. Indeed, the expression of really large
  numbers in terms of 52 involves the use of comparatively large
  multipliers and hence of more or less intricate multiplications, since
  the unit of progression is not decimal or even a multiple thereof. The
  Maya were far too clever mathematicians to have been satisfied with a
  numerical system which employed units so inconvenient as 52 or its
  multiples, and which involved processes so clumsy, and we may therefore
  dismiss the possibility of its use without further consideration.</p>

  <p>In order to keep an accurate account of the large numbers used in
  recording dates more than 3,000 years distant from the starting point, a
  numerical system was necessary whose terms could be easily handled, like
  the units, tens, hundreds, and thousands of our own decimal system.
  Whether the desire to measure accurately the passage of time actually
  gave rise to their numerical system, or vice versa, is not known, but the
  fact remains that the several periods of Maya chronology (except the
  tonalamatl, haab, and Calendar Round, previously discussed) are the exact
  terms of a vigesimal system of numeration, with but a single exception.

  <p>Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> shows the several periods of Maya
  chronology by means of which the passage of time was measured. All are
  the exact terms of a vigesimal system of numeration, except in the 2d
  place (uinals), <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>in which 18 units instead of 20 make 1 unit
  of the 3d place, or order next higher (tuns). The break in the regularity
  of the vigesimal progression in the 3d place was due probably to the
  desire to bring the unit of this order (the tun) into agreement with the
  solar year of 365 days, the number 360 being much closer to 365 than 400,
  the third term of a constant vigesimal progression. We have seen on page
  <a href="#page45">45</a> that the 18 uinals of the haab were equivalent
  to 360 days or kins, precisely the number contained in the third term of
  the above table, the tun. The fact that the haab, or solar year, was
  composed of 5 days more than the tun, thus causing a discrepancy of 5
  days as compared with the third place of the chronological system, may
  have given to these 5 closing days of the haab&mdash;that is, the xma
  kaba kin&mdash;the unlucky character they were reputed to possess.</p>

  <p>The periods were numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive, 20 units of any
  order (except the 2d) always appearing as 1 unit of the order next
  higher. For example, a number involving the use of 20 kins was written 1
  uinal instead.</p>

  <p>We are now in possession of all the different factors which the Maya
  utilized in recording their dates and in counting time:</p>

  <p>1. The names of their dates, of which there could be only 18,980 (the
  number of dates in the Calendar Round).</p>

  <p>2. The date, or starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, from which time
  was reckoned.</p>

  <p>3. The counters, that is, the units, used in measuring the passage of
  time.</p>

  <p>It remains to explain how these factors were combined to express the
  various dates of Maya chronology.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Initial Series</span></p>

  <p>The usual manner in which dates are written in both the codices and
  the inscriptions is as follows: First, there is set down a number
  composed of five periods, that is, a certain number of cycles, katuns,
  tuns, uinals, and kins, which generally aggregate between 1,300,000 and
  1,500,000 days; and this number is followed by one of the 18,980 dates of
  the Calendar Round. As we shall see in the next chapter, if this large
  number of days expressed as above be counted forward from the fixed
  starting point of Maya chronology, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the date
  invariably<a name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> reached will
  be found to be the date written at the end of the long number. This
  method of dating has been called the <i>Initial Series</i>, because when
  inscribed on a monument it invariably stands <i>at the head</i> of the
  inscription.</p>

  <p>The student will better comprehend this Initial-series method of
  dating if he will imagine the Calendar Round represented by a large
  cogwheel A, figure <a href="#fig23">23</a>, having 18,980 teeth, each one
  of which is <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>named after one of the dates of the
  calendar. Furthermore, let him suppose that the arrow B in the same
  figure points to the tooth, or cog, named <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>; and
  finally that from this as its original position the wheel commences to
  revolve in the direction indicated by the arrow in A.</p>

  <p><a name="fig23"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">
      <a href="images/fig23.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig23.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 23" title="Fig. 23" /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 23. Diagram
    showing section of Calendar-round wheel.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It is clear that after one complete revolution of A, 18,980 days will
  have passed the starting point B, and that after two revolutions 37,960
  days will have passed, and after three, 56,940, and so on. Indeed, it is
  only a question of the number of revolutions of A until as many as
  1,500,000, or any number of days in fact, will have passed the starting
  point B, or, in other words, will have elapsed since the initial date,
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>. This is actually what happened according to the
  Maya conception of time.</p>

  <p>For example, let us imagine that a certain Initial Series expresses in
  terms of cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins, the number 1,461,463,
  and that the date recorded by this number of days is <b>7 Akbal 11
  Cumhu</b>. Referring to figure <a href="#fig23">23</a>, it is evident
  that 77 revolutions of the cogwheel A, that is, 77 Calendar Rounds, will
  use up 1,461,460 of the 1,461,463 days, since 77×18,980 = 1,461,460.
  Consequently, when 77 Calendar Rounds shall have passed we shall still
  have left 3 days (1,461,463 <span class="nw">-</span> 1,461,460 = 3),
  which must be carried forward into the next Calendar Round. The
  1,461,461st day will be <b>5 Imix 9 Cumhu</b>, that is, the day following
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig23">23</a>); the 1,461,462d
  day will be <b>6 Ik 10 Cumhu</b>, and the 1,461,463d day, the last of the
  days in our Initial Series, <b>7 Akbal 11 Cumhu</b>, the date recorded.
  Examples of this method of dating (by Initial Series) will be given in
  Chapter V, where this subject will be considered in greater detail.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">THE INTRODUCING GLYPH</p>

  <p>In the inscriptions an Initial Series is invariably preceded by the
  so-called "introducing glyph," the Maya name for which is unknown. <!--
  Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>Several
  examples of this glyph are shown in figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>. This
  sign is composed of four constant elements:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. The trinal superfix.</p>
      <p>2. The pair of comblike lateral appendages.</p>
      <p>3. The tun sign (see fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>).</p>
      <p>4. The trinal subfix.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><a name="fig24"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">
      <a href="images/fig24.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig24.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 24" title="Fig. 24" /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 24.
    Initial-series "introducing glyph."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to these four constant elements there is one variable
  element which is always found between the pair of comblike lateral
  appendages. In figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
  <i>e</i>, this is a grotesque head; in <i>c</i>, a natural head; and in
  <i>d</i>, one of the 20 day-signs, <b>Ik</b>. This element varies greatly
  throughout the inscriptions, and, judging from its central position in
  the "introducing glyph" (itself the most prominent character in every
  inscription in which it occurs), it must have had an exceedingly
  important meaning.<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> A
  variant of the comblike appendages is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, in which these elements are
  replaced by a pair of fishes. However, in such cases, all of which occur
  at Copan, the treatment of the fins and tail of the fish strongly
  suggests the elements they replace, and it is not improbable, therefore,
  that the comblike appendages of the "introducing glyph" are nothing more
  nor less than conventionalized fish fins or tails; in other words, that
  they are a kind of glyphic synecdoche in which a part (the fin) stands
  for the whole (the fish). That the original form of this element was the
  fish and not its conventionalized fin (*<img src="images/glyph65.jpg"
  class="inright glright" style="height:5.36ex;" alt="" title="" />) seems
  to be indicated by several facts: (1) On Stela D at Copan, where only
  full-figure glyphs are presented,<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> the two comblike appendages of the
  "introducing glyph" appear unmistakably as two fishes. (2) In some of the
  earliest stelæ at Copan, as Stelæ 15 and P, while these elements are not
  fish forms, a head (fish?) appears with the conventionalized comb element
  in each case. The writer believes the interpretation of this phenomenon
  to be, that at the early epoch in which <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>Stelæ 15 and P were
  erected the conventionalization of the element in question had not been
  entirely accomplished, and that the head was added to indicate the form
  from which the element was derived. (3) If the fish was the original form
  of the comblike element in the "introducing glyph," it was also the
  original form of the same element in the katun glyph. (Compare the comb
  elements (&dagger;<img src="images/glyph66a.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.43ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) in figures <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>e</i>, and
  <a href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i> with each other.)
  If this is true, a natural explanation for the use of the fish in the
  katun sign lies near at hand. As previously explained on page <a
  href="#page28">28</a>, the comblike element stands for the sound
  <i>ca</i> (<i>c</i> hard); while <i>kal</i> in Maya means 20. Also the
  element (**<img src="images/glyph66b.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:5.71ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) stands for the sound <i>tun</i>. Therefore <i>catun</i> or
  <i>katun</i> means 20 tuns. But the Maya word for "fish," <i>cay</i>
  (<i>c</i> hard) is also a close phonetic approximation of the sound
  <i>ca</i> or <i>kal</i>. Consequently, the fish sign may have been the
  original element in the katun glyph, which expressed the concept 20, and
  which the conventionalization of glyphic forms gradually reduced to the
  element (&dagger;&dagger;<img src="images/glyph66c.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.5ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) without destroying, however, its phonetic value.</p>

  <p>Without pressing this point further, it seems not unlikely that the
  comblike elements in the katun glyph, as well as in the "introducing
  glyph," may well have been derived from the fish sign.</p>

  <p>Turning to the codices, it must be admitted that in spite of the fact
  that many Initial Series are found therein, the "introducing glyph" has
  not as yet been positively identified. It is possible, however, that the
  sign shown in figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>f</i>, may be a form of
  the "introducing glyph"; at least it precedes an Initial Series in four
  places in the Dresden Codex (see pl. <a href="#plate32">32</a>). It is
  composed of the trinal superfix and a conventionalized fish (?).</p>

  <p>Mr. Goodman calls this glyph (fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>,
  <i>a-e</i>) the sign for the great cycle or unit of the 6th place (see
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>). He bases this identification on the
  fact that in the codices units of the 6th place stand immediately above<a
  name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> units of the 5th place
  (cycles), and consequently since this glyph stands immediately above the
  units of the 5th place in the inscriptions it must stand for the units of
  the 6th place. While admitting that the analogy here is close, the writer
  nevertheless is inclined to reject Mr. Goodman's identification on the
  following grounds: (1) This glyph <i>never</i> occurs with a numerical
  coefficient, while units of all the other orders&mdash;that is, cycles,
  katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins <i>are never</i> without them. (2) Units
  of the 6th order in the codices invariably have a numerical coefficient,
  as do all the other orders. (3) In the only three places in the
  inscriptions<a name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> in which
  six periods are seemingly recorded, though not as Initial Series, the 6th
  period has a numerical coefficient just as have the other five, and, <!--
  Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>moreover, the glyph in the 6th position is
  unlike the forms in figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>. (4) Five periods, not
  six, in every Initial Series express the distance from the starting
  point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, to the date recorded at the end of the long
  numbers.</p>

  <p>It is probable that when the meaning of the "introducing glyph" has
  been determined it will be found to be quite apart from the numerical
  side of the Initial Series, at least in so far as the distance of the
  terminal date from the starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, is
  concerned.</p>

  <p>While an Initial Series in the inscriptions, as has been previously
  explained, is invariably preceded by an "introducing glyph," the opposite
  does not always obtain. Some of the very earliest monuments at Copan,
  notably Stelæ 15, 7, and P, have "introducing glyphs" inscribed on two or
  three of their four sides, although but one Initial Series is recorded on
  each of these monuments. Examples of this use of the "introducing glyph,"
  that is, other than as standing at the head of an Initial Series, are
  confined to a few of the earliest monuments at Copan, and are so rare
  that the beginner will do well to disregard them altogether and to follow
  this general rule: That in the inscriptions a glyph of the form shown in
  figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>a-e</i>, will invariably be followed
  by an Initial Series.</p>

  <p>Having reached the conclusion that the introducing glyph was not a
  sign for the period of the 6th order, let us next examine the signs for
  the remaining orders or periods of the chronological system (cycles,
  katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins), constantly bearing in mind that these
  five periods alone express the long numbers of an Initial Series.<a
  name="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Each of the above periods has two entirely different glyphs which may
  express it. These have been called (1) The normal form; (2) The head
  variant. In the inscriptions examples of both these classes occur side by
  side in the same Initial Series, seemingly according to no fixed rule,
  some periods being expressed by their normal forms and others by their
  head variants. In the codices, on the other hand, no head-variant period
  glyphs have yet been identified, and although the normal forms of the
  period glyphs have been found, they do not occur as units in Initial
  Series.</p>

  <p>As head variants also should be classified the so-called "full-figure
  glyphs," in which the periods given in Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> are represented by full figures instead of by
  heads. In these forms, however, only the heads of the figures are
  essential, since they alone present the determining characteristics, by
  means of which in each case identification is possible. Moreover, the
  head part of any full-figure variant is characterized by precisely the
  same essential elements as the <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>corresponding head variant for the same
  period, or in other words, the addition of the body parts in full-figure
  glyphs in no way influences or changes their meanings. For this reason
  head-variant and full-figure forms have been treated together. These
  full-figure glyphs are exceedingly rare, having been found only in five
  Initial Series throughout the Maya area: (1) On Stela D at Copan; (2) on
  Zoömorph B at Quirigua; (3) on east side Stela D at Quirigua; (4) on west
  side Stela D at Quirigua; (5) on Hieroglyphic Stairway at Copan. A few
  full-figure glyphs have been found also on an oblong altar at Copan,
  though not as parts of an Initial Series, and on Stela 15 as a period
  glyph of an Initial Series.</p>

  <p>The Maya name for the period of the 5th order in Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> is unknown. It has been called "the cycle,"
  however, by Maya students, and in default of its true designation, this
  name has been generally adopted. The normal form of the cycle glyph is
  shown in figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. It
  is composed of an element which appears twice over a knotted support. The
  repeated element occurs also in the signs for the months <b>Chen, Yax,
  Zac</b>, and <b>Ceh</b> (see figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>o-v</i>,
  <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>l-p</i>). This has been called the
  <i>Cauac</i> element because it is similar to the sign for the day
  <b>Cauac</b> in the codices (fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>b'</i>),
  though on rather inadequate grounds the writer is inclined to believe.
  The head variant of the cycle glyph is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>d-f</i>. The essential characteristic of this
  grotesque head with its long beak is the hand element (*<img
  src="images/glyph68.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.79ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which forms the lower jaw, though in a <i>very few instances</i>
  even this is absent. In the full-figure forms this same head is joined to
  the body of a bird (see fig. <a href="#fig26">26</a>). The bird intended
  is clearly a parrot, the feet, claws, and beak being portrayed in a very
  realistic manner. No glyph for the cycle has yet been found in the
  codices.</p>

  <p>The period of the 4th place or order was called by the Maya the
  <i>katun</i>; that is to say, 20 tuns, since it contained 20 units of the
  3d <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>order (see Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>). The normal form of the katun glyph is shown
  in figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>a-d</i>. It is composed of the
  normal form of the tun sign (fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>) surmounted by the pair of comblike appendages, which we have
  elsewhere seen meant 20, and which were probably derived from the
  representation of a fish. The whole glyph thus graphically portrays the
  concept 20 tuns, which according to Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>
  is equal to 1 katun. The normal form of the katun glyph in the codices
  (fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) is identical with the
  normal form in the inscriptions (fig. <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>). Several head variants are found. The most easily recognized,
  though not the most common, is shown in figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>,
  <i>e</i>, in which the superfix is the same as in the normal form; that
  is, the element (&dagger;<img src="images/glyph69a.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.36ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which probably signifies 20 in this connection. To be logical,
  therefore, the head element should be the same as the head variant of the
  tun glyph, but this is not the case (see fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>,
  <i>e-h</i>). When this superfix is present, the identification of the
  head variant of the katun glyph is an easy matter, but when it is absent
  it is difficult to fix on any essential characteristic. The general shape
  of the head is like the head variant of the cycle glyph. Perhaps the oval
  (**<img src="images/glyph69b-c.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.36ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) in the top of the head in figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>,
  <i>f</i><span class="nw">-</span><i>h</i>, and the small curling fang
  (&dagger;&dagger;) represented as protruding from the back part of the
  mouth are as constant as any of the other elements. The head of the
  full-figure variant in figure <a href="#fig28">28</a> presents the same
  lack of essential characteristics as the head variant, though in this
  form the small curling fang is also found. Again, the body attached to
  this head is that of a bird which has been identified as an eagle. <!--

  <p>The period of the 3d place or order was called by the Maya the
  <i>tun</i>, which means "stone," possibly because a stone was set up
  every 360 days or each tun or some multiple thereof. Compare so-called
  hotun or katun stones described on page <a href="#page34">34</a>. The
  normal sign for the tun in the inscriptions (see fig. <a
  href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) is identical with the form
  found in the codices (see fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>c</i>). The
  head variant, which bears a general resemblance to the head variant for
  the cycle and katun, has several forms. The one most readily recognized,
  because it has the normal sign for its superfix, is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>. The determining characteristic
  of the head variant of the tun glyph, however, is the fleshless lower jaw
  (&Dagger;<img src="images/glyph70.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.64ex;" alt="" title=""

  though even this is lacking in some few cases. The form shown in figure
  <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>h</i>, is found at Palenque, where it seems
  to represent the tun period in several places. The head of the
  full-figure form (fig. <a href="#fig30">30</a>) has the same fleshless
  lower jaw for its essential characteristic as the head-variant forms in
  figure <a href="#fig29">29</a>. The body joined to this head is again

  that the moon is visible for just about 20 days in each lunation may
  account for the application of its name to the 20-day period. The normal
  form of the uinal glyph in the inscriptions (see fig. <a
  href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) is practically identical with
  the form in the codices (see fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>c</i>).

  <i>a</i>. The head variant of the uinal glyph (fig. <a
  href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>d-f</i>) is the most constant of all of the head
  forms for the various periods. Its determining characteristic is the
  large curl emerging from the back part of the mouth. The sharp-pointed
  teeth in the upper jaw are also a fairly constant feature. In very rare
  cases both of these elements are wanting. In such cases the glyph seems
  to be without determining characteristics. The animal represented in the
  full-figure variants of the uinal is that of a frog (fig. <a
  href="#fig32">32</a>,) the head of which presents precisely the same
  characteristics as the head variants of the uinal, just described. That
  the head variant of the uinal-period glyph was originally derived from
  the representation of a frog can hardly be denied in the face of such
  striking confirmatory evidence as that afforded by the full-figure form
  of the uinal in figure <a href="#fig33">33</a>. Here the spotted body,
  flattened head, prominent mouth, and bulging eyes of the frog are so
  realistically portrayed that there is no doubt as to the identity of the
  figure intended. Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 257) has pointed out in this
  connection an interesting phonetic coincidence, which can hardly be other
  than intentional. The Maya word for frog is <i>uo</i>, which is a fairly
  close phonetic approximation of <i>u</i>, the Maya word for "moon" or
  "month." Consequently, the Maya may have selected the figure of the frog
  on phonetic grounds to represent their 20-day period. If this point could
  be established it would indicate an unmistakable use of the rebus form of
  writing employed by the Aztec. That is, the figure of a frog in the
  uinal-period glyph would not recall the object which it pictures, but the
  sound of that object's name, <i>uo</i>, approximating the sound of
  <i>u</i>, which in turn expressed the intended idea, namely, the 20-day
  period. Mr. Bowditch has suggested also that the grotesque birds which
  stand for the cycle, katun, and tun periods in these full-figure forms
  may also have been chosen because of the phonetic similarity of their
  names to the names of these periods.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The period of the 1st, or lowest, order was called by the Maya
  <i>kin</i>, which meant the "sun" and by association the "day." The kin,
  as has been explained, was the primary unit used by the Maya in counting
  time. The normal form of this period glyph in the inscriptions is shown
  in figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>a</i>, which is practically
  identical with the form in the codices (fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>,
  <i>b</i>). In addition to the normal form of the kin sign, however, there
  are several other forms representing this period which can not be
  classified either as head variants or full-figure variants, as in figure
  <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>c</i>, for example, which bears no
  resemblance whatever to the normal form of the kin sign. It is difficult
  to understand how two characters as dissimilar as those shown in <i>a</i>
  and <i>c</i>, figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>, could ever be used to
  express the same idea, particularly since there seems to be no element
  common to both. Indeed, so dissimilar are they that one is almost forced
  to believe that they were derived from two entirely distinct glyphs.
  Still another and very unusual sign for the kin is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>d</i>; indeed, the writer recalls but two places
  where it occurs: Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, and Stela C (north side) at
  Quirigua. It is composed of the normal form of the sign for the day
  <b>Ahau</b> (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>e'</i>) inverted and a
  subfixial element which varies in each of the two cases. These variants
  (fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>) are found only in the
  inscriptions. The head variants of the kin period differ from each other
  as much as the various normal forms above given. The form shown in figure
  <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>e</i>, may be readily recognized by its
  subfixial element (*<img src="images/glyph72.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.79ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) and the element (&dagger;), <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>both of which appear in the normal form,
  figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>a</i>. In some cases, as in figure <a
  href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>f-h</i>, this variant also has the square irid
  and the crooked, snag-like teeth projecting from the front of the mouth.
  Again, any one of these features, or even all, may be lacking. Another
  and usually more grotesque type of head (fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>,
  <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) has as its essential element the banded headdress. A
  very unusual head variant is that shown in figure <a
  href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>k</i>, the essential characteristic of which
  seems to be the crossbones in the eye. Mr. Bowditch has included also in
  his list of kin signs the form shown in figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>,
  <i>l</i>, from an inscription at Tikal. While this glyph in fact does
  stand between two dates which are separated by one day from each other,
  that is, <b>6 Eb 0 Pop</b> and <b>7 Ben 1 Pop</b>, the writer believes,
  nevertheless, that only the element (&Dagger;<img
  src="images/glyph73.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.07ex;" alt="" title=""
  />)&mdash;an essential part of the normal form for the kin&mdash;here
  represents the period one day, and that the larger characters above and
  below have other meanings. In the full-figure variants of the kin sign
  the figure portrayed is that of a human being (fig. <a
  href="#fig35">35</a>), the head of which is similar to the one in figure
  <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, having the same banded
  headdress.<a name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This concludes the presentation of the various forms which stand for
  the several periods of Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>. After an
  exhaustive study of these as found in Maya texts the writer has reached
  the following generalizations concerning them:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Prevalence.</i> The periods in Initial Series are expressed far
  more frequently by head variants than by normal forms. The preponderance
  of the former over the latter in all Initial Series known is in the
  proportion of about 80 per cent of the total<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> against 12 per cent, the periods in the
  remaining 8 per cent being expressed by these two forms used side by
  side. In other words, four-fifths of all the Initial Series known have
  their periods expressed by head-variant glyphs.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Antiquity.</i> Head-variant period glyphs seem to have been used
  very much earlier than the normal forms. Indeed, the first use of the
  former preceded the first use of the latter by about 300 years, while in
  Initial Series normal-form period glyphs do not occur until nearly 100
  years later, or about 400 years after the first use of head variants for
  the same purpose.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Variation.</i> Throughout the range of time covered by the
  Initial Series the normal forms for any given time-period differ but
  little from one another, all following very closely one fixed type.
  Although <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>nearly 200 years apart in point of time, the
  early form of the tun sign in figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>, <i>a</i>,
  closely resembles the late form shown in <i>b</i> of the same figure, as
  to its essentials. Or again, although 375 years apart, the early form of
  the katun sign in figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>, <i>c</i>, is
  practically identical with the form in figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>,
  <i>d</i>. Instances of this kind could be multiplied indefinitely, but
  the foregoing are sufficient to demonstrate that in so far as the
  normal-form period glyphs are concerned but little variation occurred
  from first to last. Similarly, it may be said, the head variants for any
  given period, while differing greatly in appearance at different epochs,
  retained, nevertheless, the same essential characteristic throughout. For
  example, although the uinal sign in figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>,
  <i>e</i>, precedes the one in figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>, <i>f</i>,
  by some 800 years, the same essential element&mdash;the large mouth
  curl&mdash;appears in both. Again, although 300 years separate the cycle
  signs shown in <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, figure <a href="#fig36">36</a>, the
  essential characteristic of the early form (fig. <a href="#fig36">36</a>,
  <i>g</i>), the hand, is still retained as the essential part of the late
  form (<i>h</i>).</p>

    glyphs, from widely separated sites and of different epochs, showing
    persistence of essential elements.</p>
  </div>

  <p>4. <i>Derivation.</i> We have seen that the full-figure glyphs
  probably show the original life-forms from which the head variants were
  developed. And since from (2), above, it seems probable that the head
  variants are older than the so-called normal forms, we may reasonably
  infer that the full-figure glyphs represent the life-forms whose names
  the Maya originally applied to their periods, and further that the first
  signs for those periods were the heads of these life-forms. This develops
  a contradiction in our nomenclature, for if the forms which we have
  called head variants are the older signs for the periods and are by far
  the most prevalent, they should have been called the normal forms and not
  variants, and vice versa. However, the use of the term "normal forms" is
  so general that it would be unwise at this time to attempt to introduce
  any change in nomenclature.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Secondary Series</span></p>

  <p>The Initial Series method of recording dates, although absolutely
  accurate,<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> was
  nevertheless somewhat lengthy, since in order to express a single date by
  means of it eight distinct glyphs were required, namely: (1) The
  Introducing glyph; (2) the Cycle glyph; <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>(3) the Katun glyph; (4)
  the Tun glyph; (5) the Uinal glyph; (6) the Kin glyph; (7) the Day glyph;
  (8) the Month glyph. Moreover, its use in any inscription which contained
  more than one date would have resulted in needless repetition. For
  example, if all the dates on any given monument were expressed by Initial
  Series, every one would show the long distance (more than 3,000 years)
  which separated it from the common starting point of Maya chronology. It
  would be just like writing the legal holidays of the current year in this
  way: February 22d, 1913, A.&nbsp;D., May 30th, 1913, A.&nbsp;D., July 4th, 1913,
  A.&nbsp;D., December 25th, 1913, A.&nbsp;D.; or in other words, repeating in each
  case the designation of time elapsed from the starting point of Christian
  chronology.</p>

  <p>The Maya obviated this needless repetition by recording but one
  Initial Series date on a monument;<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> and from this date as a new point of
  departure they proceeded to reckon the number of days to the next date
  recorded; from this date the numbers of days to the next; and so on
  throughout that inscription. By this device the position of any date in
  the Long Count (its Initial Series) could be calculated, since it could
  be referred back to a date, the Initial Series of which was expressed.
  For example, the terminal day of the Initial Series given on page <a
  href="#page64">64</a> is <b>7 Akbal 11 Cumhu</b>, and its position in the
  Long Count is fixed by the statement in cycles, katuns, tuns, etc., that
  1,461,463 days separate it from the starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>. Now let us suppose we have the date <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b>,
  which is recorded as being 3 days later than the day <b>7 Akbal 11
  Cumhu</b>,<a name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> the Initial
  Series of which is known to be 1,461,463. It is clear that the Initial
  Series corresponding to the date <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b>, although not
  actually expressed, will also be known since it must equal 1,461,463
  (Initial Series of <b>7 Akbal 11 Cumhu</b>) + 3 (distance from <b>7 Akbal
  11 Cumhu</b> to <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b>), or 1,461,466. Therefore it
  matters not whether we count three days forward from <b>7 Akbal 11
  Cumhu</b>, or whether we count 1,461,466 days forward from the starting
  point of Maya chronology, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> since in each case the
  date reached will be the same, namely, <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b>. The
  former method, however, was used more frequently than all of the other
  methods of recording dates combined, since it insured all the accuracy of
  an Initial Series without repeating for each date so great a number of
  days.</p>

  <p>Thus having one date on a monument the Initial Series of which was
  expressed, it was possible by referring subsequent dates to it, or to
  other dates which in turn had been referred to it, to fix accurately <!--
  Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>the
  positions of any number of dates in the Long Count without the use of
  their corresponding Initial Series. Dates thus recorded are known as
  "secondary dates," and the periods which express their distances from
  other dates of known position in the Long Count, as "distance numbers." A
  secondary date with its corresponding distance number has been designated
  a Secondary Series. In the example above given the distance number 3 kins
  and the date <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b> would constitute a Secondary
  Series.</p>

  <p>Here, then, in addition to the Initial Series is a second method, the
  Secondary Series, by means of which the Maya recorded their dates. The
  earliest use of a Secondary Series with which the writer is familiar
  (that on Stela 36 at Piedras Negras) does not occur until some 280 years
  after the first Initial Series. It seems to have been a later
  development, probably owing its origin to the desire to express more than
  one date on a single monument. Usually Secondary Series are to be counted
  from the dates next preceding them in the inscriptions in which they are
  found, though occasionally they are counted from other dates which may
  not even be expressed, and which can be ascertained only by counting
  backward the distance number from its corresponding terminal date. The
  accuracy of a Secondary series date depends entirely on the fact that it
  has been counted from an Initial Series, or at least from another
  Secondary series date, which in turn has been derived from an Initial
  Series. If either of these contingencies applies to any Secondary series
  date, it is as accurate a method of fixing a day in the Long Count as
  though its corresponding Initial Series were expressed in full. If, on
  the other hand, a Secondary series date can not be referred ultimately to
  an Initial Series or to a date the Initial Series of which is known
  though it may not be expressed, such a Secondary series date becomes only
  one of the 18,980 dates of the Calendar Round, and will recur at
  intervals of every 52 years. In other words, its position in the Long
  Count will be unknown.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Calendar-round Dates</span></p>

  <p>Dates of the character just described may be called Calendar-round
  dates, since they are accurate only within the Calendar Round, or range
  of 52 years. While accurate enough for the purpose of distinguishing
  dates in the course of a single lifetime, this method breaks down when
  used to express dates covering a long period. Witness the chaotic
  condition of Aztec chronology. The Maya seem to have realized the
  limitations of this method of dating and did not employ it extensively.
  It was used chiefly at Yaxchilan on the Usamacintla River, and for this
  reason the chronology of that city is very much awry, and it is difficult
  to assign its various dates to their proper positions in the Long Count.
  <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Period-ending Dates</span></p>

  <p>The Maya made use of still another method of dating, which, although
  not so exact as the Initial Series or the Secondary Series, is, on the
  other hand, far more accurate than Calendar round dating. In this method
  a date was described as being at the end of some particular period in the
  Long Count; that is, closing a certain cycle, katun, or tun.<a
  name="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> It is clear also that in
  this method only the name <b>Ahau</b> out of the 20 given in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a> can be recorded, since it alone can stand at the end
  of periods higher than the kin. This is true, since:</p>

  <p>1. The higher periods, as the uinal, tun, katun, and cycle are exactly
  divisible by 20 in every case (see Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>),
  and&mdash;</p>

  <p>2. They are all counted from a day, <b>Ahau</b>, that is, <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>. Consequently, all the periods of the Long Count, except the
  kin or primary unit, end with days the name parts of which are the sign
  <b>Ahau</b>.</p>

  <p>This method of recording dates always involves the use of at least two
  factors, and usually three:</p>

  <p>1. A particular period of the Long Count, as Cycle 9, or Katun 14,
  etc.</p>

  <p>2. The date which ends the particular period recorded, as <b>8 Ahau 13
  Ceh</b>, or <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>, the closing dates respectively of
  Cycle 9 and Katun 14 of Cycle 9; and</p>

  <p>3. A glyph or element which means "ending" or "is ended," or which
  indicates at least that the period to which it is attached has come to
  its close.</p>

  <p>The first two of these factors are absolutely essential to this method
  of dating, while the third, the so-called "ending sign," is usually,
  though not invariably, present. The order in which these factors are
  usually found is first the date composed of the day glyph and month
  glyph, next the "ending sign," and last the glyph of the period whose
  closing day has just been recorded. Very rarely the period glyph and its
  ending sign precede the date.</p>

  <p>The ending glyph has three distinct variants: (1) the element shown as
  the prefix or superfix in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>,
  <i>t</i>, all of which are forms of the same variant; (2) the flattened
  grotesque head appearing either as the prefix or superfix in <i>i</i>,
  <i>r</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> of the same figure; and (3) the hand, which
  appears as the main element in the forms shown in figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>j-q</i>. The two first of these never stand by
  themselves but always modify some other sign. The first (fig. <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>, <i>t</i>) is always attached to the
  sign of the period whose end is recorded either as a <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>superfix (see
  fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a</i>, whereby the end of Cycle 10 is
  indicated<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>), or as a
  prefix (see <i>t</i>, whereby the end of Katun 14 is recorded). The
  second form is seen as a prefix in <i>u</i>, whereby the end of Katun 12
  is recorded, and in <i>i</i>, whereby the end of Katun 11 is shown. This
  latter sign is found also as a superfix in <i>r</i>.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 37. Ending
    signs and elements.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The hand-ending sign rarely appears as modifying period glyphs,
  although a few examples of such use have been found (see fig. <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>). This ending sign usually
  appears as the main element in a separate glyph, which precedes the sign
  of the period whose end is recorded (see fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>,
  <i>l-q</i>). In these cases the subordinate elements differ somewhat,
  although the element (*<img src="images/glyph78a-b.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) appears as the suffix in <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>q</i>, and
  the element (&dagger;) as a postfix therein, also in <i>o</i> and
  <i>p</i>. In a few cases the hand is combined with the other ending
  signs, sometimes with one and sometimes with the other. <!-- Page 79
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span></p>

  <p>The use of the hand as expressing the meaning "ending" is quite
  natural. The Aztec, we have seen, called their 52-year period the
  <i>xiuhmolpilli</i>, or "year bundle." This implies the concomitant idea
  of "tying up." As a period closed, metaphorically speaking, it was "tied
  up" or "bundled up." The Maya use of the hand to express the idea
  "ending" may be a graphic representation of the member by means of which
  this "tying up" was effected, the clasped hand indicating the closed
  period.</p>

  <p>This method of describing a date may be called "dating by period
  endings." It was far less accurate than Initial-series or
  Secondary-series dating, since a date described as occurring at the end
  of a certain katun could recur after an interval of about 18,000 years in
  round numbers, as against 374,400 years in the other 2 methods. For all
  practical purposes, however, 18,000 years was as accurate as 374,400
  years, since it far exceeds the range of time covered by the written
  records of mankind the world over.</p>

  <p>Period-ending dates were not used much, and, as has been stated above,
  they are found only in connection with the larger periods&mdash;most
  frequently with the katun, next with the cycle, and but very rarely with
  the tun. Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 176 et seq.) has reviewed fully the use
  of ending signs, and students are referred to his work for further
  information on this subject.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">U Kahlay Katunob</span></p>

  <p>In addition to the foregoing methods of measuring time and recording
  dates, the Maya of Yucatan used still another, which, however, was
  probably derived directly from the application of Period-ending dating to
  the Long Count, and consequently introduces no new elements. This has
  been designated the Sequence of the Katuns, because in this method the
  katun, or 7,200-day period, was the unit used for measuring the passage
  of time. The Maya themselves called the Sequence of the Katuns <i>u
  tzolan katun</i>, "the series of the katuns"; or <i>u kahlay uxocen
  katunob</i>, "the record of the count of the katuns"; or even more
  simply, <i>u kahlay katunob</i>, "the record of the katuns." These names
  accurately describe this system, which is simply the record of the
  successive katuns, comprising in the aggregate the range of Maya
  chronology.</p>

  <p>Each katun of the u kahlay katunob was named after the designation of
  its ending day, a practice derived no doubt from Period-ending dating,
  and the sequence of these ending days represented passed time, each
  ending day standing for the katun of which it was the close. The katun,
  as we have seen on page <a href="#page77">77</a>, always ended with some
  day <b>Ahau</b>, consequently this day-name is the only one of the twenty
  which appears in the u kahlay katunob. In this method the katuns were
  distinguished from one another, <i>not</i> by the positions <!-- Page 80
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>which they
  occupied in the cycle, as Katun 14, for example, but by the different
  days <b>Ahau</b> with which they ended, as Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>, Katun
  <b>13 Ahau</b>, etc. See Table IX.</p>

  <p>The peculiar retrograding sequence of the numerical coefficients in
  Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a>, decreasing by 2 from katun to katun, as
  2, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, etc., results directly from the number of
  days which the katun contains. Since the 13 possible numerical
  coefficients, 1 to 13, inclusive, succeed each other in endless
  repetition, 1 following immediately after 13, it is clear that in
  counting forward any given number from any given numerical coefficient,
  the resulting numerical coefficient will not be affected if we first
  deduct all the 13s possible from the number to be counted forward. The
  mathematical demonstration of this fact follows. If we count forward 14
  from any given coefficient, the same coefficient will be reached as if we
  had counted forward but 1. This is true because, (1) there are only 13
  numerical coefficients, and (2) these follow each other without
  interruption, 1 following immediately after 13; hence, when 13 has been
  reached, the next coefficient is 1, not 14; therefore 13 or any multiple
  thereof may be counted forward or backward from any one of the 13
  numerical coefficients without changing its value. This truth enables us
  to formulate the following rule for finding numerical coefficients:
  Deduct all the multiples of 13 possible from the number to be counted
  forward, and then count forward the remainder from the known coefficient,
  subtracting 13 if the resulting number is above 13, since 13 is the
  highest possible number which can be attached to a day sign. If we apply
  this rule to the sequence of the numerical coefficients in Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a>, we shall find that it accounts for the
  retrograding sequence there observed. The first katun in Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a>, Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>, is named after its ending
  day, <b>2 Ahau</b>. Now let us see whether the application of this rule
  will give us <b>13 Ahau</b> as the ending day of the next katun. The
  number to be counted forward from <b>2 Ahau</b> is 7,200, the number of
  days in one katun; therefore we must first deduct from 7,200 all the 13s
  possible. 7,200 ÷ 13 = 553<span class="spp">11</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">13</span>. In other words, after we have deducted all the
  13's possible, that is, <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>553 of them, there is a remainder of 11.
  This the rule says is to be added (or counted forward) from the known
  coefficient (in this case 2) in order to reach the resulting coefficient.
  2 + 11 = 13. Since this number is not above 13, 13 is not to be deducted
  from it; therefore the coefficient of the ending day of the second katun
  is 13, as shown in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a>. Similarly we can
  prove that the coefficient of the ending day of the third katun in Table
  <a href="#tableIX">IX</a> will be 11. Again, we have 7,200 to count
  forward from the known coefficient, in this case 13 (the coefficient of
  the ending day of the second katun). But we have seen above that if we
  deduct all the 13s possible from 7,200 there will be a remainder of 11;
  consequently this remainder 11 must be added to 13, the known
  coefficient. 13 + 11 = 24; but since this number is above 13, we must
  deduct 13 from it in order to find out the resulting coefficient. 24
  <span class="nw">-</span> 13 = 11, and 11 is the coefficient of the
  ending day of the third katun in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a>. By
  applying the above rule, all of the coefficients of the ending days of
  the katuns could be shown to follow the sequence indicated in Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a>. And since the ending days of the katuns
  determined their names, this same sequence is also that of the katuns
  themselves.</p>

  <p>The above table enables us to establish a constant by means of which
  we can always find the name of the next katun. Since 7,200 is always the
  number of days in any katun, after deducting all the 13s possible the
  remainder will always be 11, which has to be added to the known
  coefficient to find the unknown. But since 13 has to be deducted from the
  resulting number when it is above 13, subtracting 2 will always give us
  exactly the same coefficient as adding 11; consequently we may formulate
  for determining the numerical coefficients of the ending days of katuns
  the following simple rule: Subtract 2 from the coefficient of the ending
  day of the preceding katun in every case. A glance at Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a> will demonstrate the truth of this rule.</p>

  <p>In the names of the katuns given in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a> it
  is noteworthy that the positions which the ending days occupied in the
  divisions of the haab, or 365-day year, are not mentioned. For example,
  the first katun was not called Katun <b>2 Ahau 8 Zac</b>, but simply
  Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>, the month part of the day, that is, its position in
  the year, was omitted. This omission of the month parts of the ending
  days of the katuns in the u kahlay katunob has rendered this method of
  dating far less accurate than any of the others previously described
  except Calendar-round Dating. For example, when a date was recorded as
  falling within a certain katun, as Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>, it might occur
  anywhere within a period of 7,200 days, or nearly 20 years, and yet
  fulfill the given conditions. In other words, no matter how accurately
  this Katun <b>2 Ahau</b> itself might be fixed in a <i>long</i> stretch
  of time, there was always the possibility of a maximum error of about 20
  years in <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>such dating, since the statement of the
  katun did not fix a date any closer than as occurring somewhere within a
  certain 20-year period. When greater accuracy was desired the particular
  tun in which the date occurred was also given, as Tun 13 of Katun <b>2
  Ahau</b>. This fixed a date as falling somewhere within a certain 360
  days, which was accurately fixed in a much longer period of time. Very
  rarely, in the case of an extremely important event, the Calendar-round
  date was also given as <b>9 Imix 19 Zip</b> of Tun 9 of Katun <b>13
  Ahau</b>. A date thus described satisfying all the given conditions could
  not recur until after the lapse of at least 7,000 years. The great
  majority of events, however, recorded by this method are described only
  as occurring in some particular katun, as Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>, for
  example, no attempt being made to refer them to any particular division
  (tun) of this period. Such accuracy doubtless was sufficient for
  recording the events of tribal history, since in no case could an event
  be more than 20 years out of the way.</p>

  <p>Aside from this initial error, the accuracy of this method of dating
  has been challenged on the ground that since there were only thirteen
  possible numerical coefficients, any given katun, as Katun <b>2 Ahau</b>,
  for example, in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a> would recur in the
  sequence after the lapse of thirteen katuns, or about 256 years, thus
  paving the way for much confusion. While admitting that every thirteenth
  katun in the sequence had the same name (see Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a>), the writer believes, nevertheless, that when the
  sequence of the katuns was carefully kept, and the record of each entered
  immediately after its completion, so that there could be no chance of
  confusing it with an earlier katun of the same name in the sequence,
  accuracy in dating could be secured for as long a period as the sequence
  remained unbroken. Indeed, the u kahlay katunob<a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> from which the synopsis of Maya history
  given in Chapter I was compiled, accurately fixes the date of events,
  ignoring the possible initial inaccuracy of 20 years, within a period of
  more than 1,100 years, a remarkable feat for any primitive
  chronology.</p>

  <p>How early this method of recording dates was developed is uncertain.
  It has not yet been found (surely) in the inscriptions in either the
  south or the north; on the other hand, it is so closely connected with
  the Long Count and Period-ending dating, which occurs repeatedly
  throughout the inscriptions, that it seems as though the u kahlay katunob
  must have been developed while this system was still in use.</p>

  <p>There should be noted here a possible exception to the above
  statement, namely, that the u kahlay katunob has not been found in the
  inscriptions. Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 192 et seq.) has pointed out <!--
  Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>what
  seem to be traces of another method of dating. This consists of some day
  <b>Ahau</b> modified by one of the two elements shown in figure <a
  href="#fig38">38</a> (<i>a-d</i> and <i>e-h</i>, respectively). In such
  cases the month part is sometimes recorded, though as frequently the day
  <b>Ahau</b> stands by itself. It is to be noted that in the great
  majority of these cases the days <b>Ahau</b> thus modified are the ending
  days of katuns, which are either expressed or at least indicated in
  adjacent glyphs. In other words, the day <b>Ahau</b> thus modified is
  usually the ending day of the next even katun after the last date
  recorded. The writer believes that this modification of certain days
  <b>Ahau</b> by either of the two elements shown in figure <a
  href="#fig38">38</a> may indicate that such days were the katun ending
  days nearest to the time when the inscriptions presenting them were
  engraved. The snake variants shown in figure <a href="#fig38">38</a>,
  <i>a-d</i>, are all from Palenque; the knot variants (<i>e-h</i> of the
  same figure) are found at both Copan and Quirigua.</p>

  <p><a name="fig38"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 38. "Snake"
    or "knot" element as used with day sign <b>Ahau</b>, possibly
    indicating presence of the u kahlay katunob in the inscriptions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>It may be objected that one katun ending day in each inscription is
  far different from a sequence of katun ending days as shown in Table <a
  href="#tableIX">IX</a>, and that one katun ending day by itself can not
  be construed as an u kahlay katunob, or sequence of katuns. The
  difference here, however, is apparent rather than real, and results from
  the different character of the monuments and the native chronicles. The u
  kahlay katunob in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a> is but a part of a much
  longer sequence of katuns, which is shown in a number of native
  chronicles written shortly after the Spanish Conquest, and which record
  the events of Maya history for more than 1,100 years. They are in fact
  chronological synopses of Maya history, and from their very nature they
  have to do with long periods. This is not true of the monuments,<a
  name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> which, as we have seen,
  were probably set up to mark the passage of certain periods, not
  exceeding a katun in length in any case. Consequently, each monument
  would have inscribed upon it only one or two <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>katun ending days and the
  events which were connected more or less closely with it. In other words,
  the monuments were erected at short intervals<a name="NtA_56"
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> and probably recorded events
  contemporaneous with their erection, while the u kahlay katunob, on the
  other hand, were historical summaries reaching back to a remote time. The
  former were the periodicals of current events, the latter histories of
  the past. The former in the great majority of cases had no concern with
  the lapse of more than one or two katuns, while the latter measured
  centuries by the repetition of the same unit. The writer believes that
  from the very nature of the monuments&mdash;markers of current
  time&mdash;no u kahlay katunob will be found on them, but that the
  presence of the katun ending days above described indicates that the u
  kahlay katunob had been developed while the other system was still in
  use. If the foregoing be true, the signs in figure <a
  href="#fig38">38</a>, <i>a-h</i>, would have this meaning: "On this day
  came to an end the katun in which fall the accompanying dates," or some
  similar significance.</p>

  <p>If we exclude the foregoing as indicating the u kahlay katunob, we
  have but one aboriginal source, that is one antedating the Spanish
  Conquest, which probably records a count of this kind. It has been stated
  (p. <a href="#page33">33</a>) that the Codex Peresianus probably treats
  in part at least of historical matter. The basis for this assertion is
  that in this particular manuscript an u kahlay katunob is seemingly
  recorded; at least there is a sequence of the ending days of katuns
  shown, exactly like the one in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a>, that is,
  <b>13 Ahau, 11 Ahau, 9 Ahau</b>, etc.</p>

  <p>At the time of the Spanish Conquest the Long Count seems to have been
  recorded entirely by the ending days of its katuns, that is, by the u
  kahlay katunob, and the use of Initial-series dating seems to have been
  discontinued, and perhaps even forgotten. Native as well as Spanish
  authorities state that at the time of the Conquest the Maya measured time
  by the passage of the katuns, and no mention is made of any system of
  dating which resembles in the least the Initial Series so prevalent in
  the southern and older cities. While the Spanish authorities do not
  mention the u kahlay katunob as do the native writers, they state very
  clearly that this was the system used in counting time. Says Bishop Landa
  (1864: p. 312) in this connection: "The Indians not only had a count by
  years and days ... but they had a certain method of counting time and
  their affairs by ages, which they made from twenty to twenty years ...
  these they call katunes." Cogolludo (1688: lib. iv, cap. v, p. 186) makes
  a similar statement: "They count their eras and ages, which they put in
  their books from twenty to twenty years ... [these] they call katun."
  Indeed, there can be but little doubt that the u kahlay katunob had
  entirely replaced the Initial Series in recording the Long Count
  centuries before the Spanish Conquest; and if the latter method of dating
  were known <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>{85}</span>at all, the knowledge of it came only from
  half-forgotten records the understanding of which was gradually passing
  from the minds of men.</p>

  <p>It is clear from the foregoing that an important change in recording
  the passage of time took place sometime between the epoch of the great
  southern cities and the much later period when the northern cities
  flourished. In the former, time was reckoned and dates were recorded by
  Initial Series; in the latter, in so far as we can judge from
  post-Conquest sources, the u kahlay katunob and Calendar-round dating
  were the only systems used. As to when this change took place, we are not
  entirely in the dark. It is certain that the use of the Initial Series
  extended to Yucatan, since monuments presenting this method of dating
  have been found at a few of the northern cities, namely, at Chichen Itza,
  Holactun, and Tuluum. On the other hand, it is equally certain that
  Initial Series could not have been used very extensively in the north,
  since they have been discovered in only these three cities in Yucatan up
  to the present time. Moreover, the latest, that is, the most recent of
  these three, was probably contemporaneous with the rise of the Triple
  Alliance, a fairly early event of Northern Maya history. Taking these two
  points into consideration, the limited use of Initial Series in the north
  and the early dates recorded in the few Initial Series known, it seems
  likely that Initial-series dating did not long survive the transplanting
  of the Maya civilization in Yucatan.</p>

  <p>Why this change came about is uncertain. It could hardly have been due
  to the desire for greater accuracy, since the u kahlay katunob was far
  less exact than Initial-series dating; not only could dates satisfying
  all given conditions recur much more frequently in the u kahlay katunob,
  but, as generally used, this method fixed a date merely as occurring
  somewhere within a period of about 20 years.</p>

  <p>The writer believes the change under consideration arose from a very
  different cause; that it was in fact the result of a tendency toward
  greater brevity, which was present in the glyphic writing from the very
  earliest times, and which is to be noted on some of the earliest
  monuments that have survived the ravages of the passing centuries. At
  first, when but a single date was recorded on a monument, an Initial
  Series was used. Later, however, when the need or desire had arisen to
  inscribe more than one date on the same monument, additional dates were
  <i>not</i> expressed as Initial Series, each of which, as we have seen,
  involves the use of 8 glyphs, but as a Secondary Series, which for the
  record of short periods necessitated the use of fewer glyphs than were
  employed in Initial Series. It would seem almost as though Secondary
  Series had been invented to avoid the use of Initial Series when more
  than one date had to be recorded on the same monument. But this tendency
  toward brevity in dating did not cease with the invention of Secondary
  Series. Somewhat later, dating by period-endings was introduced,
  obviating the <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>necessity for the use of even one Initial
  Series on every monument, in order that one date might be fixed in the
  Long Count to which the others (Secondary Series) could be referred. For
  all practical purposes, as we have seen, Period-ending dating was as
  accurate as Initial-series dating for fixing dates in the Long Count, and
  its substitution for Initial-series dating resulted in a further saving
  of glyphs and a corresponding economy of space. Still later, probably
  after the Maya had colonized Yucatan, the u kahlay katunob, which was a
  direct application of Period-ending dating to the Long Count, came into
  general use. At this time a rich history lay behind the Maya people, and
  to have recorded all of its events by their corresponding Initial Series
  would have been far too cumbersome a practice. The u kahlay katunob
  offered a convenient and facile method by means of which long stretches
  of time could be recorded and events approximately dated; that is, within
  20 years. This, together with the fact that the practice of setting up
  dated period-markers seems to have languished in the north, thus
  eliminating the greatest medium of all for the presentation of Initial
  Series, probably gave rise to the change from the one method of recording
  time to the other.</p>

  <p>This concludes the discussion of the five methods by means of which
  the Maya reckoned time and recorded dates: (1) Initial-series dating; (2)
  Secondary-series dating; (3) Calendar-round dating; (4) Period-ending
  dating; (5) Katun-ending dating, or the u kahlay katunob. While
  apparently differing considerably from one another, in reality all are
  expressions of the same fundamental idea, the combination of the numbers
  13 and 20 (that is, 260) with the solar year conceived as containing 365
  days, and all were recorded by the same vigesimal system of numeration;
  that is:</p>

  <p>1. All used precisely the same dates, the 18,980 dates of the Calendar
  Round;</p>

  <p>2. All may be reduced to the same fundamental unit, the day; and</p>

  <p>3. All used the same time counters, those shown in Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, the student is strongly urged constantly to bear in
  mind two vital characteristics of Maya chronology:</p>

  <p>1. The absolute continuity of all sequences which had to do with the
  counting of time: The 13 numerical coefficients of the day names, the 20
  day names, the 260 days of the tonalamatl, the 365 positions of the haab,
  the 18,980 dates of the Calendar Round, and the kins, uinals, tuns,
  katuns, and cycles of the vigesimal system of numeration. When the
  conclusion of any one of these sequences had been reached, the sequence
  began anew without the interruption or omission of a single unit and
  continued repeating itself for all time.</p>

  <p>2. All Maya periods expressed not current time, but passed time, as in
  the case of our hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>

  <p>On these two facts rests the whole Maya conception of time. <!-- Page

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Chapter</span> IV</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">MAYA ARITHMETIC</p>

  <p>The present chapter will be devoted to the consideration of Maya
  arithmetic in its relation to the calendar. It will be shown how the Maya
  expressed their numbers and how they used their several time periods. In
  short, their arithmetical processes will be explained, and the
  calculations resulting from their application to the calendar will be set
  forth.</p>

  <p>The Maya had two different ways of writing their numerals,<a
  name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> namely: (1) With normal
  forms, and (2) with head variants; that is, each of the numerals up to
  and including 19 had two distinct characters which stood for it, just as
  in the case of the time periods and more rarely, the days and months. The
  normal forms of the numerals may be compared to our Roman figures, since
  they are built up by the combination of certain elements which had a
  fixed numerical value, like the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which in
  Roman notation stand for the values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000,
  respectively. The head-variant numerals, on the other hand, more closely
  resemble our Arabic figures, since there was a special head form for each
  number up to and including 13, just as there are special characters for
  the first nine figures and zero in Arabic notation. Moreover, this
  parallel between our Arabic figures and the Maya head-variant numerals
  extends to the formation of the higher numbers. Thus, the Maya formed the
  head-variant numerals for 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 by applying the
  essential characteristic of the head variant for 10 to the head variants
  for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively, just as the sign for
  10&mdash;that is, one in the tens place and zero in the units
  place&mdash;is used in connection with the signs for the first nine
  figures in Arabic notation to form the numbers 11 to 19, inclusive. Both
  of these notations occur in the inscriptions, but with very few
  exceptions<a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> no
  head-variant numerals have yet been found in the codices.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Bar and Dot Numerals</span></p>

  <p>The Maya "Roman numerals"&mdash;that is, the normal-form numerals, up
  to and including 19&mdash;were expressed by varying combinations of two
  elements, the dot (<img src="images/glyph87a.jpg" class="middle" style="height:1ex;" alt="dot" title="dot"
  />), which represented the numeral, or numerical value, 1, and the bar,
  or line (<img src="images/glyph87b.jpg" class="middle" style="height:1ex;" alt="bar" title="bar"
  />), which represented the numeral, or numerical value, 5. By various
  combinations of these two <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>elements alone the Maya expressed all the
  numerals from 1 to 19, inclusive. The normal forms of the numerals in the
  codices are shown in figure <a href="#fig39">39</a>, in which one dot
  stands for 1, two dots for 2, three dots for 3, four dots for 4, one bar
  for 5, one bar and one dot for 6, one bar and two dots for 7, one bar and
  three dots for 8, one bar and four dots for 9, two bars for 10, and so on
  up to three bars and four dots for 19. The normal forms of the numerals,
  in the inscriptions (see fig. <a href="#fig40">40</a>) are identical with
  those in the codices, excepting that they are more elaborate, the dots
  and bars both taking on various decorations. Some of the former contain a
  concentric circle (*<img src="images/glyph88a-c.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:7.43ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) or cross-hatching (**<img src="images/glyph88d-f.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7.5ex;" alt="" title=""
  />); some appear as crescents (&dagger;) or curls (&dagger;&dagger;),
  more rarely as (&Dagger;) or (&Dagger;&Dagger;). The bars show even a
  greater variety of treatment (see fig. <a href="#fig41">41</a>). All
  these decorations, however, in no way affect the numerical value of the
  bar and the dot, which remain 5 and 1, respectively, throughout the Maya
  writing. Such embellishments as those just described are found only in
  the inscriptions, and their use was probably due to the desire to make
  the bar and dot serve a decorative as well as a numerical function.</p>

  <p>An important exception to this statement should be noted here in
  connection with the normal forms for the numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16,
  and 17, that is, all which involve the use of <i>one</i> or <i>two</i>
  dots in their composition.<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> In the inscriptions, as we have seen in
  Chapter II, every glyph was a balanced picture, exactly fitting its
  allotted space, even at the cost of occasionally losing some of its
  elements. To have expressed the numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17 as
  in the codices, with just the proper number of bars and dots in each
  case, would have left unsightly gaps in the outlines of the glyph blocks
  (see fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a>, <i>a-h</i>, where these numbers are
  shown as the coefficients of the katun sign). In <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>,
  <i>e</i>, and <i>g</i> of the same figure (the numbers 1, 6, 11, and 16,
  respectively) the single dot does not fill the space on the left-hand<a
  name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> side of the bar, or bars,
  as the case may be, and consequently <!-- Page 89 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>the left-hand edge of the
  glyph block in each case is ragged. Similarly in <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>,
  <i>f</i>, and <i>h</i>, the numbers 2, 7, 12, and 17, respectively, the
  two dots at the left of the bar or bars are too far apart to fill in the
  left-hand edge of the glyph blocks neatly, and consequently in these
  cases also the left edge is ragged. The Maya were quick to note this
  discordant note in glyph design, and in the great majority of the places
  where these numbers (1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17) had to be recorded,
  other elements of a purely ornamental character were introduced to fill
  the empty spaces. In figure <a href="#fig43">43</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>,
  <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, the spaces on each side of the single dot have been
  filled with ornamental <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>crescents about the size of the dot, and
  these give the glyph in each case a final touch of balance and harmony,
  which is lacking without them. In <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, and
  <i>h</i> of the same figure a single crescent stands between the two
  numerical dots, and this again harmoniously fills in the glyph block.
  While the crescent (*<img src="images/glyph90a-b.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.86ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) is the usual form taken by this purely decorative element, crossed
  lines (**) are found in places, as in (&dagger;<img
  src="images/glyph90c-e.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7.5ex;" alt="" title=""
  />); or, again, a pair of dotted elements (&dagger;&dagger;), as in
  (&Dagger;). These variants, however, are of rare occurrence, the common
  form being the crescent shown in figure <a href="#fig43">43</a>.</p>

  <p>The use of these purely ornamental elements, to fill the empty spaces
  in the normal forms of the numerals 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 17, is a
  fruitful source of error to the student of the inscriptions. Slight
  weathering of an inscription is often sufficient to make ornamental
  crescents look exactly like numerical dots, and consequently the numerals
  1, 2, 3 are frequently mistaken for one another, as are also 6, 7, and 8;
  11, 12, and 13; and 16, 17, and 18. The student must exercise the
  greatest caution at all times in identifying these <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>numerals in the
  inscriptions, or otherwise he will quickly find himself involved in a
  tangle from which there seems to be no egress. Probably more errors in
  reading the inscriptions have been made through the incorrect
  identification of these numerals than through any other one cause, and
  the student is urged to be continually on his guard if he would avoid
  making this capital blunder.</p>

  <p>Although the early Spanish authorities make no mention of the fact
  that the Maya expressed their numbers by bars and dots, native testimony
  is not lacking on this point. Doctor Brinton (1882 b: p. 48) gives this
  extract, accompanied by the drawing shown in figure <a
  href="#fig44">44</a>, from a native writer of the eighteenth century who
  clearly describes this system of writing numbers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>They [our ancestors] used [for numerals in their calendars] dots and
  lines [i.&nbsp;e., bars] back of them; one dot for one year, two dots for two
  years, three dots for three years, four dots for four, and so on; in
  addition to these they used a line; one line meant five years, two lines
  meant ten years; if one line and above it one dot, six years; if two dots
  above the line, seven years; if three dots above, eight years; if four
  dots above the line, nine; a dot above two lines, eleven; if two dots,
  twelve; if three dots, thirteen.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This description is so clear, and the values therein assigned to the
  several combinations of bars and dots have been verified so extensively
  throughout both the inscriptions and the codices, that we are justified
  in identifying the bar and dot as the signs for five and one,
  respectively, wherever they occur, whether they are found by themselves
  or in varying combinations.</p>

  <p>In the codices, as will appear in Chapter VI, the bar and dot numerals
  were painted in two colors, black and red. These colors were used to
  distinguish one set of numerals from another, each of which has a
  different use. In such cases, however, bars of one color are never used
  with dots of the other color, each number being either all red or all
  black (see p. <a href="#page93">93</a>, footnote 1, for the single
  exception to this rule).</p>

  <p>By the development of a special character to represent the number 5
  the Maya had far surpassed the Aztec in the science of mathematics;
  indeed, the latter seem to have had but one numerical sign, the dot, and
  they were obliged to resort to the clumsy makeshift of repeating this in
  order to represent all numbers above 1. It is clearly seen that such a
  system of notation has very definite limitations, which must have
  seriously retarded mathematical progress among the Aztec.</p>

  <p>In the Maya system of numeration, which was vigesimal, there was no
  need for a special character to represent the number 20,<a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> because <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>(1) as we have seen in
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>, 20 units of any order (except the
  2d, in which only 18 were required) were equal to 1 unit of the order
  next higher, and consequently 20 could not be attached to any
  period-glyph, since this number of periods (with the above exception) was
  always recorded as 1 period of the order next higher; and (2) although
  there were 20 positions in each period except the uinal, as 20 kins in
  each uinal, 20 tuns in each katun, 20 katuns in each cycle, these
  positions were numbered not from 1 to 20, but on the contrary from 0 to
  19, a system which eliminated the need for a character expressing 20.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 45. Sign for
    20 in the codices.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In spite of the foregoing fact, however, the number 20 has been found
  in the codices (see fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>). A peculiar condition
  there, however, accounts satisfactorily for its presence. In the codices
  the sign for 20 occurs only in connection with tonalamatls, which, as we
  shall see later, were usually portrayed in such a manner that the numbers
  of which they were composed could not be presented from bottom to top in
  the usual way, but had to be written horizontally from left to right.
  This destroyed the possibility of numeration by position,<a name="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> according to the Maya point of view,
  and consequently some sign was necessary which should stand for 20
  regardless of its position or relation to others. The sign shown in
  figure <a href="#fig45">45</a> was used for this purpose. It has not yet
  been found in the inscriptions, perhaps because, as was pointed out in
  Chapter II, the inscriptions generally do not appear to treat of
  tonalamatls.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 46. Sign for
    0 in the codices.</p>
  </div>

  <p>If the Maya numerical system had no vital need for a character to
  express the number 20, a sign to represent zero was absolutely <!-- Page
  93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>indispensable. Indeed, any numerical system
  which rises to a second order of units requires a character which will
  signify, when the need arises, that no units of a certain order are
  involved; as zero units and zero tens, for example, in writing 100 in our
  own Arabic notation.</p>

  <p>The character zero seems to have played an important part in Maya
  calculations, and signs for it have been found in both the codices and
  the inscriptions. The form found in the codices (fig. <a
  href="#fig46">46</a>) is lenticular; it presents an interior decoration
  which does not follow any fixed scheme.<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> Only a very few variants occur. The
  last one in figure <a href="#fig46">46</a> has clearly as one of its
  elements the normal form (lenticular). The remaining two are different.
  It is noteworthy, however, that these last three forms all stand in the
  2d, or uinal, place in the texts in which they occur, though whether this
  fact has influenced their variation is unknown.</p>

    outline, which is also sign for 0 shown in fig. <a
    href="#fig47">47</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Both normal forms and head variants for zero, as indeed for all the
  numbers, have been found in the inscriptions. The normal forms for zero
  are shown in figure <a href="#fig47">47</a>. They are common and are
  unmistakable. An interesting origin for this sign has been suggested by
  Mr. A. P. Maudslay. On pages 75 and 76 of the Codex Tro-Cortesiano<a
  name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> the 260 days of a
  tonalamatl are graphically represented as forming the outline shown in
  figure <a href="#fig48">48</a>, <i>a</i>. Half of this (see fig. <a
  href="#fig48">48</a>, <i>b</i>) is the sign which stands for zero
  (compare with fig. <a href="#fig47">47</a>). The train of association by
  which half of the graphic representation of a tonalamatl could come to
  stand for zero is not clear. Perhaps <i>a</i> of figure <a
  href="#fig48">48</a> may have signified that a complete tonalamatl had
  passed with no additional days. From this the sign may have come to
  represent the idea of completeness as apart from the tonalamatl, and
  finally the general idea of completeness <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>applicable to any period;
  for no period could be exactly complete without a fractional remainder
  unless all the lower periods were wanting; that is, represented by zero.
  Whether this explains the connection between the outline of the
  tonalamatl and the zero sign, or whether indeed there be any connection
  between the two, is of course a matter of conjecture.</p>

  <p>There is still one more normal form for zero not included in the
  examples given above, which must be described. This form (fig. <a
  href="#fig49">49</a>), which occurs throughout the inscriptions and in
  the Dresden Codex,<a name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> is
  chiefly interesting because of its highly specialized function. Indeed,
  it was used for one purpose only, namely, to express the first, or zero,
  position in each of the 19 divisions of the haab, or year, and for no
  other. In other words, it denotes the positions <b>0 Pop</b>, <b>0
  Uo</b>, <b>0 Zip</b>, etc., which, as we have seen (pp. <a
  href="#page47">47</a>, <a href="#page48">48</a>), corresponded with our
  first days of the months. The forms shown in figure <a
  href="#fig49">49</a>, <i>a</i><span class="nw">-</span><i>e</i>, are from
  the inscriptions and those in <i>f</i><span class="nw">-</span><i>h</i>
  from the Dresden Codex. They are all similar. The general outline of the
  sign has suggested the name "the spectacle" glyph. Its essential
  characteristic seems to be the division into two roughly circular parts,
  one above the other, best seen in the Dresden Codex forms (fig. <a
  href="#fig49">49</a>, <i>f</i><span class="nw">-</span><i>h</i>) and a
  roughly circular infix in each. The lower infix is quite regular in all
  of the forms, being a circle or ring. The upper infix, however, varies
  considerably. In figure <a href="#fig49">49</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, this
  ring has degenerated into a loop. In <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> of the same
  figure it has become elaborated into a head. A simpler form is that in
  <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>. Although comparatively rare, this glyph is so
  unusual in form that it can be readily recognized. Moreover, if the
  student will bear in mind the two following points concerning its use, he
  will never fail to identify it in the inscriptions: The "spectacle" sign
  (1) can be attached only to the glyphs for the 19 divisions of the haab,
  or year, that is, the 18 uinals and the xma kaba kin; in other words, it
  is found only with the glyphs shown in figures <a href="#fig19">19</a>
  and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, the signs for the months in the inscriptions
  and codices, respectively.</p>

  zero in figure <a href="#fig46">46</a>. As these two forms never occur

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Head-variant Numerals</span></p>

  <p>Let us next turn to the consideration of the Maya "Arabic notation,"
  that is, the head-variant numerals, which, like all other known head
  variants, are practically restricted to the inscriptions.<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> It should be noted here before
  proceeding further that the full-figure numerals found in connection with
  full-figure period, day, and month glyphs in a few inscriptions, have
  been classified with the head-variant numerals. As explained on page <a
  href="#page67">67</a>, the body-parts of such glyphs have no function in
  determining their meanings, and it is only the head-parts which present
  in each case the determining characteristics of the form intended.</p>

  <p>In the "head" notation each of the numerals, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13<a name="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> is
  expressed by a distinctive type of head; each type has its own essential
  characteristic, by means of which it can be distinguished from all of the
  others. Above 13 and up to but <i>not including</i> 20, the head numerals
  are expressed by the application of the essential characteristic of the
  head for 10 to the heads for 3 to 9, inclusive. No head forms for the
  numeral 20 have yet been discovered.</p>

  <p>The identification of these head-variant numerals in some cases is not
  an easy matter, since their determining characteristics are not always
  presented clearly. Moreover, in the case of a few numerals, notably the
  heads for 2, 11, and 12, the essential elements have not yet been
  determined. Head forms for these numerals occur so rarely in the
  inscriptions that the comparative data are insufficient to enable us to
  fix on any particular element as the essential one. Another difficulty
  encountered in the identification of head-variant numerals is the
  apparent irregularity of the forms in the earlier inscriptions. The
  essential elements of these early head numerals in some cases seem to
  differ widely from those of the later forms, and consequently it is
  sometimes difficult, indeed even impossible, to determine their
  corresponding numerical values. <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span></p>

  <p><a name="fig51"></a></p>

  </div>

  <p>The head-variant numerals are shown in figures <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>-<a href="#fig53">53</a>. Taking these up in their
  numerical order, let us commence with the head signifying 1; see figure
  <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>a-e</i>. The essential element of this head
  is its forehead ornament, which, to signify the number 1, must be
  composed of more than one part (*<img src="images/glyph97a.jpg"
  class="inright glright" style="height:6.43ex;" alt="" title="" />), in
  order to distinguish it from the forehead ornament (**<img
  src="images/glyph97b.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.64ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which, as we shall see presently, is the essential element of the
  head for 8 (fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>). Except for their
  forehead ornaments the heads for 1 and 8 are almost identical, and great
  care must be exercised in order to avoid mistaking one for the other.
  <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span></p>

  <p>The head for 2 (fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) has
  been found only twice in the inscriptions&mdash;on Lintel 2 at Piedras
  Negras and on the tablet in the Temple of the Initial Series at Holactun.
  The oval at the top of the head seems to be the only element these two
  forms have in common, and the writer therefore accepts this element as
  the essential characteristic of the head for 2, admitting at the same
  time that the evidence is insufficient.</p>

  <p>The head for 3 is shown in figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>h</i>,
  <i>i</i>. Its determining characteristic is the fillet, or headdress.</p>

  <p>The head for 4 is shown in figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>j-m</i>.
  It is to be distinguished by its large prominent eye and square irid
  (*<img src="images/glyph98a.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.14ex;" alt="" title=""

  <p>The head for 5 (fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>n-s</i>) is always to
  be identified by its peculiar headdress (&dagger;<img

  href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. The same element appears also
  in the head for 15 (see fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>b-e</i>). The
  head for 5 is one of the most constant of all the head numerals.</p>

  <p>The head for 6 (fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>t-v</i>) is similarly

  (&dagger;&dagger;<img src="images/glyph99b.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.79ex;" alt="" title=""

  <p>The head for 7 (fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>w</i>) is found only
  once in the inscriptions&mdash;on the east side of Stela D at Quirigua.
  Its essential characteristic, <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>the large ornamental scroll passing under
  the eye and curling up in front of the forehead (&Dagger;<img
  src="images/glyph100a.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:7ex;" alt="" title=""

  <i>j-m</i>).</p>

  <p>The head for 8 is shown in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>.
  It is very similar to the head for 1, as previously explained (compare
  figs. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>a-e</i> and <a href="#fig52">52</a>,
  <i>a-f</i>), and is to be distinguished from it only by the character of
  the forehead ornament, which is composed of but a single element
  (&Dagger;&Dagger;<img src="images/glyph100b.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7.5ex;" alt="" title=""

  the form of a large curl. In <i>c</i> of the same figure a flaring
  element is added above the curl and in <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> this element
  replaces the curl. In <i>f</i> the tongue or tooth of a grotesque animal
  head forms the forehead ornament. The heads for 18 (fig. <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>n-q</i>) follow the first variants (fig. <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), having the large curl, except
  <i>q</i>, which is similar to <i>d</i> in having a flaring element
  instead.</p>

  <p>The head for 9 occurs more frequently than all of the others with the
  exception of the zero head, because the great majority of all Initial
  Series record dates which fell after the completion of Cycle 9, but
  before the completion of Cycle 10. Consequently, 9 is the coefficient
  attached to the cycle glyph in almost all Initial Series.<a name="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> The head for 9 is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>g-l</i>. It has for its essential characteristic
  the dots on the lower cheek or around the mouth (*<img
  src="images/glyph100c.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.29ex;" alt="" title=""
  />). Sometimes these occur in a circle or again irregularly.
  Occasionally, as in <i>j-l</i>, the 9 head has a beard, though this is
  not a constant element as are the dots, which appear also in the head for
  19. Compare figure <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>r</i>.</p>

  <p>The head for 10 (fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>) is
  extremely important since its essential element, the fleshless lower jaw
  (*<img src="images/glyph100d.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), stands for the numerical value 10, in composition with the heads for
  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, to form the heads for 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
  and 19, respectively. The 10 head is clearly the fleshless skull, having
  the truncated nose and fleshless jaws (see fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>,
  <i>m-p</i>). The fleshless lower jaw is shown in profile in all cases but
  one&mdash;Zoömorph B at Quirigua (see <i>r</i> of the same figure). Here
  a full front view of a 10 head is shown in which the fleshless jaw
  extends clear across the lower part of the head, an interesting
  confirmation of the fact that this characteristic is the essential
  element of the head for 10.</p>

  <p>The head for 11 (fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>s</i>) has been
  found only once in the inscriptions, namely, on Lintel 2 at Piedras
  Negras; hence comparative data are lacking for the determination of its
  essential element. This head has no fleshless lower jaw and consequently
  would seem, therefore, not to be built up of the heads for 1 and 10.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the head for 12 (fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>t-v</i>)
  has no fleshless lower jaw, and consequently can not be composed of the
  heads for 10 and 2. It is to be noted, however, that all three of the
  faces are of the same type, even though their essential characteristic
  has not yet been determined. <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span></p>

  <p>The head for 13 is shown in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>,
  <i>w-b'</i>. Only the first of these forms, <i>w</i>, however, is built
  on the 10 + 3 basis. Here we see the characteristic 3 head with its
  banded headdress or fillet (compare <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, fig. <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>), to which has been added the essential element of
  the 10 head, the fleshless lower jaw, the combination of the two giving
  the head for 13. The other form for 13 seems to be a special character,
  and not a composition of the essential elements of the heads for 3 and
  10, as in the preceding example. This form of the 13 head (fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>x-b'</i>) is grotesque. It seems to be
  characterized by its long pendulous nose surmounted by a curl (*<img
  src="images/glyph101a-b.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.57ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), its large bulging eye (**), and a curl (&dagger;<img
  src="images/glyph101c-d.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.64ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) or fang (&dagger;&dagger;) protruding from the back part of the
  mouth. Occurrences of the first type&mdash;the composite head&mdash;are
  very rare, there being only two examples of this kind known in all the
  inscriptions. The form given in <i>w</i> is from the Temple of the Cross
  at Palenque, and the other is on the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Copan. The
  individual type, having the pendulous nose, bulging eye, and mouth curl
  is by far the more frequent.</p>

  <p>The head for 14 (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>a</i>) is found but
  once&mdash;in the inscriptions on the west side of Stela F at Quirigua.
  It has the fleshless lower jaw denoting 10, while the rest of the head
  shows the characteristics of 4&mdash;the bulging eye and snaglike tooth
  (compare fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>j-m</i>). The curl protruding
  from the back part of the mouth is wanting because the whole lower part
  of the 4 head has been replaced by the fleshless lower jaw.</p>

  <p>The head for 15 (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>b-e</i>) is composed
  of the essential element of the 5 head (the tun sign; see fig. <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>n-s</i>) and the fleshless lower jaw of the head
  for 10.</p>

  <p>The head for 16 (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>f-i</i>) is
  characterized by the fleshless lower jaw and the hatchet eye of the 6
  head. Compare figures <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>t-v</i>, and <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>, which together form 16 (10 + 6).</p>

  <p>The head for 17 (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>j-m</i>) is composed
  of the essential element of the 7 head (the scroll projecting above the
  nose; see fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>w</i>) and the fleshless lower
  jaw of the head for 10.</p>

  <p>The head for 18 (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>n-q</i>) has the
  characteristic forehead ornament of the 8 head (compare fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>) and the fleshless lower jaw denoting
  10.</p>

  <p>Only one example (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>r</i>) of the 19
  head has been found in the inscriptions. This occurs on the Temple of the
  Cross at Palenque and seems to be formed regularly, both the dots of the
  9 head and the fleshless lower jaw of the 10 head appearing.</p>

  <p>The head for 0 (zero), figure <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>s-w</i>, is
  always to be distinguished by the hand clasping the lower part of the
  face (*<img src="images/glyph101e.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:7.07ex;" alt="" title=""
  />). In this sign for zero, the hand probably represents the idea
  "ending" or "closing," just as it seems to have done in the ending signs
  used with <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>Period-ending dates. According to the Maya
  conception of time, when a period had ended or closed it was at zero, or
  at least no new period had commenced. Indeed, the normal form for zero in
  figure <a href="#fig47">47</a>, the head variant for zero in figure <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>s-w</i>, and the form for zero shown in figure
  <a href="#fig54">54</a> are used interchangeably in the same inscription
  to express the same idea&mdash;namely, that no periods thus modified are
  involved in the calculations and that consequently the end of some higher
  period is recorded; that is, no fractional parts of it are present.</p>

  <p>That the hand in "ending signs" had exactly the same meaning as the
  hand in the head variants for zero (fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>,
  <i>s-w</i>) receives striking corroboration from the rather unusual sign
  for zero shown in figure <a href="#fig54">54</a>, to which attention was
  called above. The essential elements of this sign are<a name="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> (1) the clasped hand, identical with
  the hand in the head-variant forms for zero, and (2) the large element
  above it, containing a curling infix. This latter element also occurs
  though below the clasped hand, in the "ending signs" shown in figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, the first two of
  which accompany the closing date of Katun 14, and the last the closing
  date of Cycle 13. The resemblance of these three "ending signs" to the
  last three forms in figure <a href="#fig54">54</a> is so close that the
  conclusion is well-nigh inevitable that they represented one and the same
  idea. The writer is of the opinion that this meaning of the hand (ending
  or completion) will be found to explain its use throughout the
  inscriptions.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 54. A sign
    for 0, used also to express the idea "ending" or "end of" in
    Period-ending dates. (See figs. <a href="#fig47">47</a> and <a
    href="#fig53">53</a> <i>s-w</i>, for forms used interchangeably in the
    inscriptions to express the idea of 0 or of completion.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>In order to familiarize the student with the head-variant numerals,
  their several essential characteristics have been gathered together in
  Table <a href="#tableX">X</a>, where they may be readily consulted.
  Examples covering their use with period, day, and month glyphs are given
  in figure <a href="#fig55">55</a> with the corresponding English
  translations below.</p>

  <p>Head-variant numerals do not occur as frequently as the bar and dot
  forms, and they seem to have been developed at a much later period. At
  least, the earliest Initial Series recorded with bar and dot numerals
  antedates by nearly two hundred years the earliest Initial Series the
  numbers of which are expressed by head variants. This long priority in
  the use of the former would doubtless be considerably diminished if it
  were possible to read the earliest Initial Series which <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>have
  head-variant numerals; but that the earliest of these latter antedate the
  earnest bar and dot Initial Series may well be doubted.</p>

  <p>Mention should be made here of a numerical form which can not be
  classified either as a bar and dot numeral or a head variant. This is the
  thumb (*<img src="images/glyph103.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:8.21ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which has a numerical value of one.</p>

  <p>We have seen in the foregoing pages the different characters which
  stood for the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive. The next point claiming our
  attention is, how were the higher numbers written, numbers which in the
  codices are in excess of 12,000,000, and in the inscriptions, in excess
  of 1,400,000? In short, how were numbers so large expressed by the
  foregoing twenty (0 to 19, inclusive) characters?</p>

  <p>The Maya expressed their higher numbers in two ways, in both of which
  the numbers rise by successive terms of the same vigesimal system:</p>

  <p>1. By using the numbers 0 to 19, inclusive, as multipliers with the
  several periods of Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> (reduced in each
  case to units of the lowest order) as the multiplicands, and&mdash;</p>

  <p>2. By using the same numbers<a name="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> in certain relative positions, each of
  which had a fixed numerical value of its own, like the positions to the
  right and left of the decimal point in our own numerical notation. <!--
  Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span></p>

  <p>The first of these methods is rarely found outside of the
  inscriptions, while the second is confined exclusively to the codices.
  Moreover, although the first made use of both normal-form and
  head-variant numerals, the second could be expressed by normal forms
  only, that is, bar and dot numerals. This enables us to draw a comparison
  between these two forms of Maya numerals:</p>

  <p><a name="fig55"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:55%;">
      <a href="images/fig55.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig55.jpg"

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 55. Examples
    of the use of head-variant numerals with period, day, or month signs.
    The translation of each glyph appears below it.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Head-variant numerals never occur independently, but are always
  prefixed to some period, day, or month sign. Bar and dot numerals, on the
  other hand, frequently stand by themselves in the codices unattached to
  other signs. In such cases, however, some sign was to be supplied
  mentally with the bar and dot numeral. <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">First Method of Numeration</span></p>

  <p><a name="fig56"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:56%;">
      <a href="images/fig56.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig56.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 56" title="Fig. 56" /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 56. Examples
    of the first method of numeration, used almost exclusively in the
    inscriptions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the first of the above methods the numbers 0 to 19, inclusive, were
  expressed by multiplying the kin sign by the numerals<a name="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> 0 to 19 in turn. Thus, for example, 6
  days was written as shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>a</i>, 12
  days as shown in <i>b</i>, and 17 days as shown in <i>c</i> of the same
  <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>figure. In other words, up to and
  including 19 the numbers were expressed by prefixing the sign for the
  number desired to the kin sign, that is, the sign for 1 day.<a
  name="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The numbers 20 to 359, inclusive, were expressed by multiplying both
  the kin and uinal signs by the numerical forms 0 to 19, and adding
  together the resulting products. For example, the number 257 was written
  as shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>d</i>. We have seen in
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> that 1 uinal = 20 kins, consequently
  12 uinals (the 12 being indicated by 2 bars and 2 dots) = 240 kins.
  However, as this number falls short of 257 by 17 kins, it is necessary to
  express these by 17 kins, which are written immediately below the 12
  uinals. The sum of these two products = 257. Again, the number 300 is
  written as in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>e</i>. The 15 uinals
  (three bars attached to the uinal sign) = 15 × 20 = 300 kins, exactly the
  number expressed. However, since no kins are required to complete the
  number, it is necessary to show that none were involved, and consequently
  0 kins, or "no kins" is written immediately below the 15 uinals, and 300
  + 0 = 300. One more example will suffice to show how the numbers 20 to
  359 were expressed. In figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>f</i>, the
  number 198 is shown. The 9 uinals = 9 × 20 = 180 kins. But this number
  falls short of 198 by 18, which is therefore expressed by 18 kins written
  immediately below the 9 uinals: and the sum of these two products is 198,
  the number to be recorded.</p>

  <p>The numbers 360 to 7,199, inclusive, are indicated by multiplying the
  kin, uinal, and tun signs by the numerals 0 to 19, and adding together
  the resulting products. For example, the number 360 is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>g</i>. We have seen in Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> that 1 tun = 18 uinals; but 18 uinals = 360
  kins (18 × 20 = 360); therefore 1 tun also = 360 kins. However, in order
  to show that no uinals and kins are involved in forming this number, it
  is necessary to record this fact, which was done by writing 0 uinals
  immediately below the 1 tun, and 0 kins immediately below the 0 uinals.
  The sum of these three products equals 360 (360 + 0 + 0 = 360). Again,
  the number 3,602 is shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>h</i>.
  The 10 tuns = 10 × 360 = 3,600 kins. This falls short of 3,602 by only 2
  units of the first order (2 kins), therefore no uinals are involved in
  forming this number, a fact which is shown by the use of 0 uinals between
  the 10 tuns and 2 kins. The sum of these three products = 3,602 (3,600 +
  0 + 2). Again, in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>i</i>, the number
  7,100 is recorded. The 19 tuns = 19 × 360 = 6,840 kins, which falls short
  of 7,100 kins by 7,100 <span class="nw">-</span> 6,840 = 260 kins. But
  260 kins = 13 uinals with no kins <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>remaining.
  Consequently, the sum of these products equals 7,100 (6,840 + 260 +
  0).</p>

  <p>The numbers 7,200 to 143,999 were expressed by multiplying the kin,
  uinal, tun, and katun signs by the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, and
  adding together the resulting products. For example, figure <a
  href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>j</i>, shows the number 7,204. We have seen in
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> that 1 katun = 20 tuns, and we have
  seen that 20 tuns = 7,200 kins (20 × 360); therefore 1 katun = 7,200
  kins. This number falls short of the number recorded by exactly 4 kins,
  or in other words, no tuns or uinals are involved in its composition, a
  fact shown by the 0 tuns and 0 uinals between the 1 katun and the 4 kins.
  The sum of these four products = 7,204 (7,200 + 0 + 0 + 4). The number
  75,550 is shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>k</i>. The 10
  katuns = 72,000; the 9 tuns, 3,240; the 15 uinals, 300; and the 10 kins,
  10. The sum of these four products = 75,550 (72,000 + 3,240 + 300 + 10).
  Again, the number 143,567 is shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>,
  <i>l</i>. The 19 katuns = 136,800; the 18 tuns, 6,480; the 14 uinals,
  280; and the 7 kins, 7. The sum of these four products = 143,567 (136,800
  + 6,480 + 280 + 7).</p>

  <p>The numbers 144,000 to 1,872,000 (the highest number, according to
  some authorities, which has been found<a name="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> in the inscriptions) were expressed by
  multiplying the kin, uinal, tun, katun, and cycle signs by the numerals 0
  to 19, inclusive, and adding together the resulting products. For
  example, the number 987,322 is shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>,
  <i>m</i>. We have seen in Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> that 1
  cycle = 20 katuns, but 20 katuns = 144,000 kins; therefore 6 cycles =
  864,000 kins; and 17 katuns = 122,400 kins; and 2 tuns, 720 kins; and 10
  uinals, 200 kins; and the 2 kins, 2 kins. The sum of these five products
  equals the number recorded, 987,322 (864,000 + 122,400 + 720 + 200 + 2).
  The highest number in the inscriptions upon which all are agreed is
  1,872,000, as shown in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>n</i>. It
  equals 13 cycles (13 × 144,000), and consequently all the periods
  below&mdash;the katun, tun, uinal, and kin&mdash;are indicated as being
  used 0 times.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Number of Cycles in a Great Cycle</span></p>

  <p>This brings us to the consideration of an extremely important point
  concerning which Maya students entertain two widely different opinions;
  and although its presentation will entail a somewhat lengthy digression
  from the subject under consideration it is so pertinent to the general
  question of the higher numbers and their formation, that the writer has
  thought best to discuss it at this point.</p>

  <p>In a vigesimal system of numeration the unit of increase is 20, and so
  far as the codices are concerned, as we shall presently see, this <!--
  Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>number was in fact the only unit of
  progression used, except in the 2d order, in which 18 instead of 20 units
  were required to make 1 unit of the 3d order. In other words, in the
  codices the Maya carried out their vigesimal system to <i>six places</i>
  without a break other than the one in the 2d place, just noted. See Table
  <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.</p>

  <p>In the inscriptions, however, there is some ground for believing that
  only 13 units of the 5th order (cycles), not 20, were required to make 1
  unit of the 6th order, or 1 great cycle. Both Mr. Bowditch (1910: App.
  IX, 319-321) and Mr. Goodman (1897: p. 25) incline to this opinion, and
  the former, in Appendix IX of his book, presents the evidence at some
  length for and against this hypothesis.</p>

  <p>This hypothesis rests mainly on the two following points:</p>

  <p>1. That the cycles in the inscriptions are numbered from 1 to 13,
  inclusive, and not from 0 to 19, inclusive, as in the case of all the
  other periods except the uinal, which is numbered from 0 to 17,
  inclusive.</p>

  <p>2. That the only two Initial Series which are not counted from the
  date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting point of Maya chronology, are
  counted from a date <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, which is exactly 13 cycles in
  advance of the former date.</p>

  <p>Let us examine the passages in the inscriptions upon which these
  points rest. In three places<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> in the inscriptions the date <b>4 Ahau
  8 Cumhu</b> is declared to have occurred at the end of a Cycle 13; that
  is, in these three places this date is accompanied by an "ending sign"
  and a Cycle 13. In another place in the inscriptions, although the
  starting point <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> is not itself expressed, the second
  cycle thereafter is declared to have been a Cycle 2, not a Cycle 15, as
  it would have been had the cycles been numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive,
  like all the other periods.<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> In still another place the ninth cycle
  after the starting point (that is, the end of a Cycle 13) is not a Cycle
  2 in the <i>following</i> great cycle, as would be the case if the cycles
  were numbered from 0 to 19, inclusive, but a Cycle 9, as if the cycles
  were numbered from 1 to 13. Again, the end of the tenth cycle after the
  starting point is recorded in several places, but not as Cycle 3 of the
  following great cycle, as if the cycles were numbered from 0 to 19,
  inclusive, but as Cycle 10, as would be the case if the cycles were
  numbered from 1 to 13. The above examples leave little doubt that the
  cycles were numbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, and not from 0 to 19, as in
  the case of the other periods. Thus, there can be no question concerning
  the truth of the first of the two above points on which this hypothesis
  rests. <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>

  <p>But because this is true it does not necessarily follow that 13 cycles
  made 1 great cycle. Before deciding this point let us examine the two
  Initial Series mentioned above, as <i>not</i> proceeding from the date
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, but from a date <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, exactly 13
  cycles in advance of the former date.</p>

  <p>These are in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque and on the east side
  of Stela C at Quirigua. In these two cases, if the long numbers expressed
  in terms of cycles, katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins are reduced to kins,
  and counted forward from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting
  point of Maya chronology, in neither case will the recorded terminal day
  of the Initial Series be reached; hence these two Initial Series could
  not have had the day <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> as their starting point. It
  may be noted here that these two Initial Series are the only ones
  throughout the inscriptions known at the present time which are not
  counted from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.<a name="NtA_77"
  href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> However, by counting <i>backward</i>
  each of these long numbers from their respective terminal days, <b>8 Ahau
  18 Tzec</b>, in the case of the Palenque Initial Series, and <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>, in the case of the Quirigua Initial Series, it will be found
  that both of them proceed from the same starting point, a date <b>4 Ahau
  8 Zotz</b>, exactly 13 cycles in advance of the starting point of Maya
  chronology. Or, in other words, the starting point of all Maya Initial
  Series save two, was exactly 13 cycles later than the starting point of
  these two. Because of this fact and the fact that the cycles were
  numbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, as shown above, Mr. Bowditch and Mr.
  Goodman have reached the conclusion that in the inscriptions only 13
  cycles were required to make 1 great cycle.</p>

  <p>It remains to present the points against this hypothesis, which seem
  to indicate that the great cycle in the inscriptions contained the same
  number of cycles (20) as in the codices:</p>

  <p>1. In the codices where six orders (great cycles) are recorded it
  takes 20 of the 5th order (cycles) to make 1 of the 6th order. This
  absolute uniformity in a strict vigesimal progression in the codices, so
  similar in other respects to the inscriptions, gives presumptive support
  at least to the hypothesis that the 6th order in the inscriptions was
  formed in the same way.</p>

  <p>2. The numerical system in both the codices and inscriptions is
  identical even to the slight irregularity in the second place, where only
  18 instead of 20 units were required to make 1 of the third place. It
  would seem probable, therefore, that had there been any irregularity in
  the 5th place in the inscriptions (for such the use of 13 in a vigesimal
  system must be called), it would have been found also in the codices.
  <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span></p>

  <p>3. Moreover, in the inscriptions themselves the cycle glyph occurs at
  least twice (see fig. <a href="#fig57">57</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) with a
  coefficient greater than 13, which would seem to imply that more than 13
  cycles could be recorded, and consequently that it required more than 13
  to make 1 of the period next higher. The writer knows of no place in the
  inscriptions where 20 kins, 18 uinals, 20 tuns, or 20 katuns are
  recorded, each of these being expressed as 1 uinal, 1 tun, 1 katun, and 1
  cycle, respectively.<a name="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>
  Therefore, if 13 cycles had made 1 great cycle, 14 cycles would not have
  been recorded, as in figure <a href="#fig57">57</a>, <i>a</i>, but as 1
  great cycle and 1 cycle; and 17 cycles would not have been recorded, as
  in <i>b</i> of the same figure, but as 1 great cycle and 4 cycles. The
  fact that they were not recorded in this latter manner would seem to
  indicate, therefore, that more than 13 cycles were required to make a
  great cycle, or unit of the 6th place, in the inscriptions as well as in
  the codices.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The above points are simply positive evidence in support of this
  hypothesis, however, and in no way attempt to explain or otherwise
  account for the undoubtedly contradictory points given in the discussion
  of (1) on pages <a href="#page108">108</a>-<a href="#page109">109</a>.
  Furthermore, not until these contradictions have been cleared away can it
  be established that the great cycle in the inscriptions was of the same
  length as the great cycle in the codices. The writer believes the
  following explanation will satisfactorily dispose of these contradictions
  and make possible at the same time the acceptance of the theory that the
  great cycle in the inscriptions and in the codices was of equal length,
  being composed in each case of 20 cycles.</p>

  <p>Assuming for the moment that there were 13 cycles in a great cycle; it
  is clear that if this were the case 13 cycles could never be recorded in
  the inscriptions, for the reason that, being equal to 1 great cycle, they
  would have to be recorded in terms of a great cycle. This is true because
  no period in the inscriptions is ever expressed, so far as now known, as
  the full number of the periods of which it was composed. For example, 1
  uinal never appears as 20 kins; 1 tun is never written as its equivalent,
  18 uinals; 1 katun is never recorded as 20 tuns, etc. Consequently, if a
  great cycle composed of 13 cycles had come to its end with the end of a
  Cycle 13, which fell on a day <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, such a Cycle 13
  could never have been expressed, since in its place would have been
  recorded the end of the great cycle which fell on the same day. In other
  words, if there had been 13 cycles in a great cycle, the cycles would
  have been numbered from 0 to 12, inclusive, and the last, Cycle 13, would
  have been recorded instead as completing some great cycle. It is
  necessary to <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>admit this point or repudiate the
  numeration of all the other periods in the inscriptions. The writer
  believes, therefore, that, when the starting point of Maya chronology is
  declared to be a date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, which an "ending sign" and a
  Cycle 13 further declare fell at the close of a Cycle 13, this does not
  indicate that there were 13 cycles in a great cycle, but that it is to be
  interpreted as a Period-ending date, pure and simple. Indeed, where this
  date is found in the inscriptions it occurs with a Cycle 13, and an
  "ending sign" which is practically identical with other undoubted "ending
  signs." Moreover, if we interpret these places as indicating that there
  were only 13 cycles in a great cycle, we have equal grounds for saying
  that the great cycle contained only 10 cycles. For example, on Zoömorph G
  at Quirigua the date <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b> is accompanied by an "ending
  sign" and Cycle 10, which on this basis of interpretation would signify
  that a great cycle had only 10 cycles. Similarly, it could be shown by
  such an interpretation that in some cases a cycle had 14 katuns, that is,
  where the end of a Katun 14 was recorded, or 17 katuns, where the end of
  a Katun 17 was recorded. All such places, including the date <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>, which closed a Cycle 13 at the starting point of Maya
  chronology, are only Period-ending dates, the writer believes, and have
  no reference to the number of periods which any higher period contains
  whatsoever. They record merely the end of a particular period in the Long
  Count as the end of a certain Cycle 13, or a certain Cycle 10, or a
  certain Katun 14, or a certain Katun 17, as the case may be, and contain
  no reference to the beginning or the end of the period next higher.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt, however, as stated above, that the cycles were
  numbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, and then began again with 1. This
  sequence strikingly recalls that of the numerical coefficients of the
  days, and in the parallel which this latter sequence affords, the writer
  believes, lies the true explanation of the misconception concerning the
  length of the great cycle in the inscriptions.</p>

  <p>The numerical coefficients of the days, as we have seen, were numbered
  from 1 to 13, inclusive, and then began again with 1. See <!-- Page 112
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>Table <a
  href="#tableXI">XI</a>, in which the 20 days of the month <b>Pop</b> are
  enumerated. Now it is evident from this table that, although the
  coefficients of the days themselves do not rise above 13, the numbers
  showing the positions of these days in the month continue up through 19.
  In other words, two different sets of numerals were used in describing
  the Maya days: (1) The numerals 1 to 13, inclusive, the coefficients of
  the days, and an integral part of their names; and (2) The numerals 0 to
  19, inclusive, showing the positions of these days in the divisions of
  the year&mdash;the uinals, and the xma kaba kin. It is clear from the
  foregoing, moreover, that the number of possible day coefficients (13)
  has nothing whatever to do in determining the number of days in the
  period next higher. That is, although the coefficients of the days are
  numbered from 1 to 13, inclusive, it does not necessarily follow that the
  next higher period (the uinal) contained only 13 days. Similarly, the
  writer believes that while the cycles were undoubtedly
  numbered&mdash;that is, named&mdash;from 1 to 13, inclusive, like the
  coefficients of the days, it took 20 of them to make a great cycle, just
  as it took 20 kins to make a uinal. The two cases appear to be parallel.
  Confusion seems to have arisen through mistaking the <i>name</i> of the
  period for its <i>position</i> in the period next higher&mdash;two
  entirely different things, as we have seen.</p>

  <p>A somewhat similar case is that of the katuns in the u kahlay katunob
  in Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a>. Assuming that a cycle commenced with
  the first katun there given, the name of this katun is Katun <b>2
  Ahau</b>, although it occupied the <i>first</i> position in the cycle.
  Again, the name of the second katun in the sequence is Katun <b>13
  Ahau</b>, although it occupied the second position in the cycle. In other
  words, the katuns of the u kahlay katunob were named quite independently
  of their position in the period next higher (the cycle), and their names
  do not indicate the corresponding positions of the katun in the period
  next higher.</p>

  <p>Applying the foregoing explanation to those passages in the
  inscriptions which show that the enumeration of the cycles was from 1 to
  13, inclusive, we may interpret them as follows: When we find the date
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> in the inscriptions, accompanied by an "ending
  sign" and a Cycle 13, that "Cycle 13," even granting that it stands at
  the end of some great cycle, does not signify that there were only 13
  cycles in the great cycle of which it was a part. On the contrary, it
  records only the end of a particular Cycle 13, being a Period-ending date
  pure and simple. Such passages no more fix the length of the great cycle
  as containing 13 cycles than does the coefficient 13 of the day name
  <b>13 Ix</b> in Table <a href="#tableXI">XI</a> limit the number of days
  in a uinal to 13, or, again, the 13 of the katun name <b>13 Ahau</b> in
  Table <a href="#tableIX">IX</a> limit the number of katuns in a cycle to
  13. This explanation not only accounts for the use of the 14 cycles or 17
  cycles, as <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>shown in figure <a href="#fig57">57</a>,
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, but also satisfactorily provides for the enumeration
  of the cycles from 1 to 13, inclusive.</p>

  <p>If the date "<b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> ending Cycle 13" be regarded as a
  Period-ending date, not as indicating that the number of cycles in a
  great cycle was restricted to 13, the next question is&mdash;Did a great
  cycle also come to an end on the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>&mdash;the
  starting point of Maya chronology and the closing date of a Cycle 13?
  That it did the writer is firmly convinced, although final proof of the
  point can not be presented until numerical series containing more than 5
  terms shall have been considered. (See pp. <a href="#page114">114</a>-<a
  href="#page127">127</a> for this discussion.) The following points,
  however, which may be introduced here, tend to prove this condition:</p>

  <p>1. In the natural course of affairs the Maya would have commenced
  their chronology with the beginning of some great cycle, and to have done
  this in the Maya system of counting time&mdash;that is, by elapsed
  periods&mdash;it was necessary to reckon from the end of the preceding
  great cycle as the starting point.</p>

  <p>2. Moreover, it would seem as though the natural cycle with which to
  commence counting time would be a <i>Cycle 1</i>, and if this were done
  time would have to be counted from a <i>Cycle 13</i>, since a Cycle 1
  could follow only a Cycle 13.</p>

  <p>On these two probabilities, together with the discussion on pages <a
  href="#page114">114</a>-<a href="#page127">127</a>, the writer is
  inclined to believe that the Maya commenced their chronology with the
  beginning of a great cycle, whose first cycle was named Cycle 1, which
  was reckoned from the close of a great cycle whose ending cycle was a
  Cycle 13 and whose ending day fell on the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>The second point (see p. <a href="#page108">108</a>) on which rests
  the hypothesis of "13 cycles to a great cycle" in the inscriptions admits
  of no such plausible explanation as the first point. Indeed, it will
  probably never be known why in two inscriptions the Maya reckoned time
  from a starting point different from that used in all the others, one,
  moreover, which was 13 cycles in advance of the other, or more than 5,000
  years earlier than the beginning of their chronology, and more than 8,000
  years earlier than the beginning of their historic period. That this
  remoter starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, from which proceed so far
  as known only two inscriptions throughout the whole Maya area, stood at
  the <i>end</i> of a great cycle the writer does not believe, in view of
  the evidence presented on pages <a href="#page114">114</a>-<a
  href="#page127">127</a>. On the contrary, the material given there tends
  to show that although the cycle which ended on the day <b>4 Ahau 8
  Zotz</b> was also named Cycle 13,<a name="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> it was the 8th division of the grand
  cycle which ended on the day <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, <!-- Page 114
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>the starting
  point of Maya chronology, and not the closing division of the preceding
  grand cycle. However, without attempting to settle this question at this
  time, the writer inclines to the belief, on the basis of the evidence at
  hand, that the great cycle in the inscriptions was of the same length as
  in the codices, where it is known to have contained 20 cycles.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let us return to the discussion interrupted on page <a
  href="#page107">107</a>, where the first method of expressing the higher
  numbers was being explained. We saw there how the higher numbers up to
  and including 1,872,000 were written, and the digression just concluded
  had for its purpose ascertaining how the numbers above this were
  expressed; that is, whether 13 or 20 units of the 5th order were equal to
  1 unit of the 6th order. It was explained also that this number,
  1,872,000, was perhaps the highest which has been found in the
  inscriptions. Three possible exceptions, however, to this statement
  should be noted here: (1) On the east side of Stela N at Copan six
  periods are recorded (see fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>); (2) on the west
  panel from the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque six and probably
  <i>seven</i> periods occur (see fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>); and (3) on
  Stela 10 at Tikal eight and perhaps <i>nine</i> periods are found (see
  fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). If in any of these cases all of the
  periods belong to one and the same numerical series, the resulting
  numbers would be far higher than 1,872,000. Indeed, such numbers would
  exceed by many millions all others throughout the range of Maya writings,
  in either the codices or the inscriptions.</p>

  <p>Before presenting these three numbers, however, a distinction should
  be drawn between them. The first and second (figs. <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, <a href="#fig59">59</a>) are clearly not Initial
  Series. Probably they are Secondary Series, although this point can not
  be established with certainty, since they can not be connected with any
  known date the position of which is definitely fixed. The third number
  (fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>), on the other hand, is an Initial Series,
  and the eight or nine periods of which it is composed may fix the initial
  date of Maya chronology (<b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>) in a much grander
  chronological scheme, as will appear presently.</p>

  href="#fig58">58</a> with the highest period involved and reading up,
  A6,<a name="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> the 14 great cycles
  = 40,320,000 kins (see Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>, in which 1
  great cycle = 2,880,000, and consequently 14 = 14 × 2,880,000 = <!-- Page
  115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>40,320,000); A5, the 17 cycles = 2,448,000
  kins (17 × 144,000); A4, the 19 katuns = 136,800 kins (19 × 7,200); A3,
  the 10 tuns = 3,600 kins (10 × 360); A2, the 0 uinals, 0 kins; and the 0
  kins, 0 kins. The sum of these products = 40,320,000 + 2,448,000 +
  136,800 + 3,600 + 0 + 0 = 42,908,400.</p>

  <p>The second of these three numbers (see fig. <a href="#fig59">59</a>),
  if all of its seven terms belong to one and the same number, equals
  455,393,401. Commencing at the bottom as in figure <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, the first term A4, has the coefficient 7. Since
  this is the term following the sixth, or great cycle, we may call it the
  great-great cycle. But we have seen that the <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>great cycle =
  2,880,000; therefore the great-great cycle = twenty times this number, or
  57,600,000. Our text shows, however, that seven of these great-great
  cycles are used in the number in question, therefore our first term =
  403,200,000. The rest may be reduced by means of Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a> as follows: B3, 18 great cycles = 51,840,000;
  A3, 2 cycles = 288,000; B2, 9 katuns = 64,800; A2, 1 tun = 360; B1, 12
  uinals = 240; B1, 1 kin = 1. The sum of these (403,200,000 + 51,840,000 +
  288,000 + 64,800 + 360 + 240 +1) = 455,393,401.</p>

  <p>The third of these numbers (see fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>), if all
  of its terms belong to one and the same number, equals 1,841,639,800.
  Commencing with A2, this has a coefficient of 1. Since it immediately
  follows the great-great cycle, which we found above consisted of
  57,600,000, we may assume that it is the great-great-great cycle, and
  that it consisted of 20 great-great cycles, or 1,152,000,000. Since its
  coefficient is only 1, this large number itself will be the first term in
  our series. The rest may readily be reduced as follows: A3, 11
  great-great cycles = 633,600,000; A4, 19 great cycles = 54,720,000; A5, 9
  cycles = 1,296,000; A6, 3 katuns = 21,600; A7, 6 tuns = 2,160; A8, 2
  uinals = 40; A9, 0 kins = 0.<a name="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> The sum of these (1,152,000,000 +
  633,600,000 + 54,720,000 + 1,296,000 + 21,600 + 2,160 + 40 + 0) =
  1,841,639,800, the highest number found anywhere in the Maya writings,
  equivalent to about 5,000,000 years.</p>

  <p>Whether these three numbers are actually recorded in the inscriptions
  under discussion depends solely on the question whether or not the terms
  above the cycle in each belong to one and the same series. If it could be
  determined with certainty that these higher periods in each text were all
  parts of the same number, there would be no further doubt as to the
  accuracy of the figures given above; and more important still, the 17
  cycles of the first number (see A5, fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>) would
  then prove conclusively that more than 13 cycles were required to make a
  great cycle in the inscriptions as well as in the codices. And
  furthermore, the 14 great cycles in A6, figure <a href="#fig58">58</a>,
  the 18 in B3, figure <a href="#fig59">59</a>, and the 19 in A4, figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>, would also prove that more than 13 great cycles
  were required to make one of the period next higher&mdash;that is, the
  great-great cycle. It is needless to say that this point has not been
  universally admitted. Mr. Goodman (1897: p. 132) has suggested in the
  case of the Copan inscription (fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>) that only
  the lowest four periods&mdash;the 19 katuns, the 10 tuns, the 0 uinals,
  and the 0 kins&mdash;A2, A3, and A4,<a name="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> here form the number; and that if this
  number is counted backward from the Initial Series of the inscription, it
  will reach a Katun 17 of the preceding cycle. Finally, Mr. Goodman <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>believes this Katun 17 is declared in the
  glyph following the 19 katuns (A5), which the writer identifies as 17
  cycles, and consequently according to the Goodman interpretation the
  whole passage is a Period-ending date. Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 321) also
  offers the same interpretation as a possible reading of this passage.
  Even granting the truth of the above, this interpretation still leaves
  unexplained the lowest glyph of the number, which has a coefficient of 14
  (A6).</p>

  <p>The strongest proof that this passage will not bear the construction
  placed on it by Mr. Goodman is afforded by the very glyph upon which his
  reading depends for its verification, namely, the glyph which he
  interprets Katun 17. This glyph (A5) bears no resemblance to the katun
  sign standing immediately above it, but on the contrary has for its lower
  jaw the clasping hand (*<img src="images/glyph117.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.29ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), which, as we have seen, is the determining characteristic of the
  cycle head. Indeed, this element is so clearly portrayed in the glyph in
  question that its identification as a head variant for the cycle follows
  almost of necessity. A comparison of this glyph with the head variant of
  the cycle given in figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>d-f</i>, shows that
  the two forms are practically identical. This correction deprives Mr.
  Goodman's reading of its chief support, and at the same time increases
  the probability that all the 6 terms here recorded belong to one and the
  same number. That is, since the first five are the kin, uinal, tun,
  katun, and cycle, respectively, it is probable that the sixth and last,
  which follows immediately the fifth, without a break or interruption of
  any kind, belongs to the same series also, in which event this glyph
  would be most likely to represent the units of the sixth order, or the
  so-called great cycles.</p>

  <p>The passages in the Palenque and Tikal texts (figs. <a
  href="#fig59">59</a> and <a href="#fig60">60</a>, respectively) have
  never been satisfactorily explained. In default of calendric checks, as
  the known distance between two dates, for example, which may be applied
  to these three numbers to test their accuracy, the writer knows of no
  better check than to study the characteristics of this possible
  great-cycle glyph in all three, and of the possible great-great-cycle
  glyph in the last two.</p>

  <p>Passing over the kins, the normal form of the uinal glyph appears in
  figures <a href="#fig58">58</a>, A2, and 59, B1 (see fig. <a
  href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and the head variant in figure
  <a href="#fig60">60</a>, A8. (See fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>,
  <i>d-f</i>.) Below the uinal sign in A3, figure <a href="#fig58">58</a>,
  and A2, figure <a href="#fig59">59</a>, and above A7, in figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a> the tuns are recorded as head variants, in all three
  of which the fleshless lower jaw, the determining characteristic of the
  tun head, appears. Compare these three head variants with the head
  variant for the tun in figure <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>d-g</i>. In the
  Copan inscription (fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a>) the katun glyph, A4,
  appears as a head variant, the essential elements of which seem to be the
  oval in the top part of the head and the curling fang protruding from the
  back part of the mouth. Compare this head with the head variant for the
  katun in figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>e-h</i>. In the Palenque and
  Tikal texts (see <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, B2, and <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>, A6, respectively), on the other hand, the katun is
  expressed by its normal form, which is identical with the normal form
  shown in figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. In figures
  <a href="#fig58">58</a>, A5, and <a href="#fig59">59</a>, A3, the cycle
  is expressed by its head variant, and the determining characteristic, the
  clasped hand, appears in both. Compare the cycle signs in figures <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, A5, and <a href="#fig59">59</a>, A3, with the head
  variant for the cycle shown in figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>;
  <i>d-f</i>. The cycle glyph in the Tikal text (fig. <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>, A5) is clearly the normal form. (See fig. <a
  href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>a-c</i>.) The glyph following the cycle sign in
  these three texts (standing above the cycle sign in figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a> at A4) probably stands for the period of the sixth
  order, the so-called great cycle. These three glyphs are redrawn in
  figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a-c</i>, respectively. In the Copan
  inscription this glyph (fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a</i>) is a head
  variant, while in the Palenque and Tikal texts (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of
  the same figure, respectively) it is a normal form.</p>

  <p>Inasmuch as these three inscriptions are the only ones in which
  numerical series composed of 6 or more consecutive terms are recorded, it
  is unfortunate that the sixth term in all three should not have been
  expressed by the same form, since this would have facilitated their
  comparison. Notwithstanding this handicap, however, the writer believes
  it will be possible to show clearly that the head variant in figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a</i>, and the normal forms in <i>b</i> and
  <i>c</i> are only variants of one and the same sign, and that all three
  stand for one and the same thing, namely, the great cycle, or unit of the
  sixth order.</p>

    Inscriptions, Palenque; <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, Stela 10, Tikal.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the first place, it will be noted that each of the three glyphs
  just mentioned is composed in part of the cycle sign. For example, in
  figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a</i>, the head variant has the same
  clasped hand as the head-variant cycle sign in the same text (see fig. <a
  href="#fig58">58</a>, A5), which, as we have seen elsewhere, is the
  determining characteristic of the head variant for the cycle. In figure
  <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, the normal forms there
  presented contain the entire normal form for the cycle sign; compare
  figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>. Indeed, except for
  its superfix, the glyphs in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>b</i>,
  <i>c</i>, are normal forms of the cycle sign; and the glyph in <i>a</i>
  of the same figure, except for its superfixial element, is similarly the
  head variant for the cycle. It would seem, therefore, that the
  determining characteristics of these three glyphs must be their
  superfixial elements. In the normal form in figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>b</i>, the superfix is very clear. Just inside
  the outline and parallel to it there is a line of smaller circles, <!--
  Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>and
  in the middle there are two infixes like shepherds' crooks facing away
  from the center (*<img src="images/glyph119.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.57ex;" alt="" title=""
  />). In <i>c</i> of the last-mentioned figure the superfix is of the same
  size and shape, and although it is partially destroyed the left-hand
  "shepherd's crook" can still be distinguished. A faint dot treatment
  around the edge can also still be traced. Although the superfix of the
  head variant in <i>a</i> is somewhat weathered, enough remains to show
  that it was similar to, if indeed not identical with, the superfixes of
  the normal forms in <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. The line of circles defining
  the left side of this superfix, as well as traces of the lower ends of
  the two "shepherd's crook" infixes, appears very clearly in the lower
  part of the superfix. Moreover, in general shape and proportions this
  element is so similar to the corresponding elements in figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, that, taken together with the
  similarity of the other details pointed out above, it seems more than
  likely that all three of these superfixes are one and the same element.
  The points which have led the writer to identify glyphs <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a> as forms for the
  great cycle, or period of the sixth order, may be summarized as
  follows:</p>

  <p>1. All three of these glyphs, head-variant as well as normal forms,
  are made up of the corresponding forms of the cycle sign plus another
  element, a superfix, which is probably the determining characteristic in
  each case.</p>

  <p>2. All three of these superfixes are probably identical, thus showing
  that the three glyphs in which they occur are probably variants of the
  same sign.</p>

  <p>3. All three of these glyphs occur in numerical series, the preceding
  term of which in each case is a cycle sign, thus showing that by position
  they are the logical "next" term (the sixth) of the series.</p>

  <p>Let us next examine the two texts in which great-great-cycle glyphs
  may occur. (See figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, <a href="#fig60">60</a>.)
  The two glyphs which may possibly be identified as the sign for this
  period are shown in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>d</i>,
  <i>e</i>.</p>

  <p>A comparison of these two forms shows that both are composed of the
  same elements: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix in which the hand is
  the principal element.</p>

  <p>The superfix in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>d</i>, consists of
  a hand and a tassel-like postfix, not unlike the upper half of the ending
  signs in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l-q</i>. However, in the
  present case, if we accept the hypothesis that <i>d</i> of figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a> is the sign for the great-great cycle, we are
  obliged to see in its superfix alone the essential <i>element</i> of the
  great-great-cycle sign, since the <i>rest</i> of this glyph (the lower
  part) is quite clearly the normal form for the cycle.</p>

  <p>The superfix in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>e</i>, consists of
  the same two elements as the above, with the slight difference that the
  hand in <i>e</i> holds a rod. Indeed, the similarity of the two forms is
  so close that in default of <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>any evidence to the contrary the writer
  believes they may be accepted as signs for one and the same period,
  namely, the great-great cycle.</p>

  <p>The points on which this conclusion is based may be summarized as
  follows:</p>

  <p>1. Both glyphs are made up of the same elements&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The
  normal form of the cycle sign; (<i>b</i>) a superfix composed of a hand
  with a tassel-like postfix.</p>

  <p>2. Both glyphs occur in numerical series the next term but one of
  which is the cycle, showing that by position they are the logical next
  term but one, the seventh or great-great cycle, of the series.</p>

  <p>3. Both of these glyphs stand next to glyphs which have been
  identified as great-cycle signs, that is, the sixth terms of the series
  in which they occur.</p>

  <p>By this same line of reasoning it seems probable that A2 in figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a> is the sign for the great-great-great cycle,
  although this fact can not be definitely established because of the lack
  of comparative evidence.</p>

  <p>This possible sign for the great-great-great cycle, or period of the
  8th order, is composed of two parts, just like the signs for the great
  cycle and the great-great cycle already described. These are: (1) The
  cycle sign; (2) a superfix composed of a hand and a semicircular postfix,
  quite distinct from the superfixes of the great cycle and great-great
  cycle signs.</p>

  <p>However, since there is no other inscription known which presents a
  number composed of eight terms, we must lay aside this line of
  investigation and turn to another for further light on this point.</p>

  <p>An examination of figure <a href="#fig60">60</a> shows that the glyphs
  which we have identified as the signs for the higher periods (A2, A3, A4,
  and A5,) contain one element common to all&mdash;the sign for the cycle,
  or period of 144,000 days. Indeed, A5 is composed of this sign alone with
  its usual coefficient of 9. Moreover, the next glyphs (A6, A7, A8, and
  A9<a name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>) are the signs for
  the katun, tun, uinal, and kin, respectively, and, together with A5, form
  a regular descending series of 5 terms, all of which are of known
  value.</p>

  <p>The next question is, How is this glyph in the sixth place formed? We
  have seen that in the only three texts in which more than five periods
  are recorded this sign for the sixth period is composed of the same
  elements in each: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix containing two
  "shepherd's crook" infixes and surrounded by dots.</p>

  <p>Further, we have seen that in two cases in the inscriptions the cycle
  sign has a coefficient greater than 13, thus showing that in all
  probability 20, not 13, cycles made 1 great cycle.</p>

  <p>Therefore, since the great-cycle signs in figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a-c</i>, are composed of the cycle sign plus a
  superfix (*<img src="images/glyph120.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.07ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), this superfix must have the value of 20 in order to make the whole
  glyph have the value of <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>20 cycles, or 1 great cycle (that is, 20 ×
  144,000 = 2,880,000). In other words, it may be accepted (1) that the
  glyphs in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a-c</i>, are signs for the
  great cycle, or period of the sixth place; and (2) that the great cycle
  was composed of 20 cycles shown graphically by two elements, one being
  the cycle sign itself and the other a superfix having the value of
  20.</p>

  <p>It has been shown that the last six glyphs in figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a> (A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9) all belong to the same
  series. Let us next examine the seventh glyph or term from the bottom
  (A3) and see how it is formed. We have seen that in the only two texts in
  which more than six periods are recorded the signs for the seventh period
  (see fig. <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>) are composed of
  the same elements in each: (1) The cycle sign; (2) a superfix having the
  hand as its principal element. We have seen, further, that in the only
  three places in which great cycles are recorded in the Maya writing (fig.
  <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a-c</i>) the coefficient in every case is
  greater than 13, thus showing that in all probability 20, not 13, great
  cycles made 1 great-great cycle.</p>

  <p>Therefore, since the great-great cycle signs in figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, are composed of the cycle sign
  plus a superfix (*<img src="images/glyph121.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.14ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), this superfix must have the value of 400 (20 × 20) in order to make
  the whole glyph have the value of 20 great cycles, or 1 great-great cycle
  (20 × 2,880,000 = 57,600,000). In other words, it seems highly probable
  (1) that the glyphs in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>d</i>,
  <i>e</i>, are signs for the great-great cycle or period of the seventh
  place, and (2) that the great-great cycle was composed of 20 great
  cycles, shown graphically by two elements, one being the cycle sign
  itself and the other a hand having the value of 400.</p>

  <p>It has been shown that the first seven glyphs (A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8,
  and A9) probably all belong to the same series. Let us next examine the
  eighth term (A2) and see how it is formed.</p>

  <p>As stated above, comparative evidence can help us no further, since
  the text under discussion is the only one which presents a number
  composed of more than seven terms. Nevertheless, the writer believes it
  will be possible to show by the morphology of this, the only glyph which
  occupies the position of an eighth term, that it is 20 times the glyph in
  the seventh position, and consequently that the vigesimal system was
  perfect to the highest known unit found in the Maya writing.</p>

  <p>We have seen (1) that the sixth term was composed of the fifth term
  plus a superfix which increased the fifth 20 times, and (2) that the
  seventh term was composed of the fifth term plus a superfix which
  increased the fifth 400 times, or the sixth 20 times.</p>

  <p>Now let us examine the only known example of a sign for the eighth
  term (A2, fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). This glyph is composed of (1)
  the cycle sign; (2) a superfix of two elements, (<i>a</i>) the hand, and
  (<i>b</i>) a semicircular element in which dots appear. <!-- Page 122
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>But this same hand in the super-fix of the great-great cycle increased
  the cycle sign 400 times (20 × 20; see A3, fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>).
  Therefore we must assume the same condition obtains here. And finally,
  since the eighth term = 20 × 20 × 20 × cycle, we must recognize in the
  second element of the superfix (*<img src="images/glyph122.jpg"
  class="inleft glleft" style="height:6ex;" alt="" title="" />) a sign
  which means 20.</p>

  <p>A close study of this element shows that it has two important points
  of resemblance to the superfix of the great-cycle glyph (see A4, fig. <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>), which was shown to have the value 20: (1) Both
  elements have the same outline, roughly semicircular; (2) both elements
  have the same chain of dots around their edges.</p>

  <p>Compare this element in A2, figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>, with the
  superfixes in figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, bearing
  in mind that there is more than 275 years' difference in time between the
  carving of A2, figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>, and <i>a</i>, figure <a
  href="#fig61">61</a>, and more than 200 years between the former and
  figure <a href="#fig61">61</a>, <i>b</i>. The writer believes both are
  variants of the same element, and consequently A2, figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>, is probably composed of elements which signify 20 ×
  400 (20 × 20) × the cycle, which equals one great-great-great cycle, or
  term of the eighth place.</p>

  <p>Thus on the basis of the glyphs themselves it seems possible to show
  that all belong to one and the same numerical series, which progresses
  according to the terms of a vigesimal system of numeration.</p>

  <p>The several points supporting this conclusion may be summarized as
  follows:</p>

  <p>1. The eight periods<a name="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
  in figure <a href="#fig60">60</a> are consecutive, their sequence being
  uninterrupted throughout. Consequently it seems probable that all belong
  to one and the same number.</p>

  <p>2. It has been shown that the highest three period glyphs are composed
  of elements which multiply the cycle sign by 20, 400, and 8,000,
  respectively, which has to be the case if they are the sixth, seventh,
  and eighth terms, respectively, of the Maya vigesimal system of
  numeration.</p>

  <p>3. The highest three glyphs have numerical coefficients, just like the
  five lower ones; this tends to show that all eight are terms of the same
  numerical series.</p>

  <p>4. In the two texts which alone can furnish comparative data for this
  sixth term, the sixth-period glyph in each is identical with A4, figure
  <a href="#fig60">60</a>, thus showing the existence of a sixth period in
  the inscriptions and a generally<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> accepted sign for it.</p>

  <p>5. In the only other text which can furnish comparative data for the
  seventh term, the period glyph in its seventh place is identical <!--
  Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>with
  A3, figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>; thus showing the existence of a
  seventh period in the inscriptions and a generally accepted sign for
  it.</p>

  <p>6. The one term higher than the cycle in the Copan text, the two terms
  higher in the Palenque text, and the three terms higher in this text, are
  all built on the same basic element, the cycle, thus showing that in each
  case the higher term or terms is a continuation of the same number, not a
  Period-ending date, as suggested by Mr. Goodman for the Copan text.</p>

  <p>7. The other two texts, showing series composed of more than five
  terms, have all their period glyphs in an unbroken sequence in each, like
  the text under discussion, thus showing that in each of these other two
  texts all the terms present probably belong to one and the same
  number.</p>

  <p>8. Finally, the two occurrences of the cycle sign with a coefficient
  above 13, and the three occurrences of the great-cycle sign with a
  coefficient above 13, indicate that 20, not 13, was the unit of
  progression in the higher numbers in the inscriptions just as it was in
  the codices.</p>

  <p>Before closing the discussion of this unique inscription, there is one
  other important point in connection with it which must be considered,
  because of its possible bearing on the meaning of the Initial-series
  introducing glyph.</p>

  <p>The first five glyphs on the east side of Stela 10 at Tikal are not
  illustrated in figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>. The sixth glyph is A1 in
  figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>, and the remaining glyphs in this figure
  carry the text to the bottom of this side of the monument. The first of
  these five unfigured glyphs is very clearly an Initial-series introducing
  glyph. Of this there can be no doubt. The second resembles the day <b>8
  Manik</b>, though it is somewhat effaced. The remaining three are
  unknown. The next glyph, A1, figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>, is very
  clearly another Initial-series introducing glyph, having all of the five
  elements common to that sign. Compare A1 with the forms for the Initial
  series introducing glyph in figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>. This
  certainly would seem to indicate that an Initial Series is to follow.
  Moreover, the fourth glyph of the eight-term number following in A2-A9,
  inclusive (that is, A5), records "Cycle 9," the cycle in which
  practically all Initial-series dates fall. Indeed, if A2, A3, and A4 were
  omitted and A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9 were recorded immediately after A1,
  the record would be that of a regular Initial-series number (9.3.6.2.0).
  Can this be a matter of chance? If not, what effect can A2, A3, and A4
  have on the Initial-series date in A1, A5-A9?</p>

  <p>The writer believes that the only possible effect they could have
  would be to fix Cycle 9 of Maya chronology in a far more comprehensive
  and elaborate chronological conception, a conception which <!-- Page 124
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>indeed
  staggers the imagination, dealing as it does with more than five million
  years.</p>

  <p>If these eight terms all belong to one and the same numerical series,
  a fact the writer believes he has established in the foregoing pages, it
  means that Cycle 9, the first historic period of the Maya civilization,
  was Cycle 9 of Great Cycle 19 of Great-great Cycle 11 of
  Great-great-great Cycle 1. In other words, the starting point of Maya
  chronology, which we have seen was the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, 9
  cycles before the close of a Cycle 9, was in reality 1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0.
  0. 0. <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, or simply a fixed point in a far vaster
  chronological conception.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it proves, as contended by the writer on page <a
  href="#page113">113</a>, that a great cycle came to an end on this date,
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>. This is true because on the above date (1. 11. 19.
  0. 0. 0. 0. 0. <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>) all the five periods lower than the
  great cycle are at 0. It proves, furthermore, as the writer also
  contended, that the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, 13 cycles in advance of
  the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, did not end a great cycle&mdash;</p>

  <p>but, on the contrary, was a Cycle 7 of Great Cycle 18, the end of
  which (19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>) was the starting point
  of Maya chronology.</p>

  <p>It seems to the writer that the above construction is the only one
  that can be put on this text if we admit that the eight periods in A2-A9,
  figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>, all belong to one and the same numerical
  series.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it would show that the great cycle in which fell the
  first historic period of the Maya civilization (Cycle 9) was itself the
  closing great cycle of a great-great cycle, namely, Great-great Cycle
  11:</p>

<table class="mc">

</table>

  <p>That is to say, that when Great Cycle 19 had completed itself,
  Great-great Cycle 12 would be ushered in.</p>

  <p>We have seen on pages <a href="#page108">108</a>-<a
  href="#page113">113</a> that the names of the cycles followed one another
  in this sequence: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, etc., to Cycle 13, which was
  followed by Cycle 1, and the sequence repeated itself. We saw, however,
  that these names probably had nothing to do with the positions of the
  cycles in the great cycle; that on the contrary these numbers were names
  and not positions in a higher term.</p>

  <p>Now we have seen that Maya chronology began with a Cycle 1; that is,
  it was counted from the end of a Cycle 13. Therefore, the <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>closing cycle
  of Great Cycle 19 of Great-great Cycle 11 of Great-great-great Cycle 1
  was a Cycle 13, that is to say, 1. 11. 19. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. <b>4 Ahau 13
  Cumhu</b> concluded a great cycle, the closing cycle of which was named
  Cycle 13. This large number, composed of <i>one</i> great-great-great
  cycle, <i>eleven</i> great-great cycles, and <i>nineteen</i> great
  cycles, contains exactly 12,780 cycles, as below:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr025">1 great-great-great cycle </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = 1 × 20 × 20 × 20 cycles </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = </td><td class="ar pl0"> 8,000 cycles</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">11 great-great cycles </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = 11 × 20 × 20 cycles </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = </td><td class="ar pl0"> 4,400 cycles</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">19 great cycles </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = 19 × 20 cycles </td><td class="pl0 pr025"> = </td><td class="ar pl0"> 380 cycles</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="al pl0"> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl0"> 12,780 cycles</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>But the closing cycle of this number was named Cycle 13, and by
  deducting all the multiples of 13 possible (983) we can find the name of
  the first cycle of Great-great-great Cycle 1, the highest Maya time
  period of which we have any knowledge: 983 × 13 = 12,779. And deducting
  this from the number of cycles involved (12,780), we have&mdash;</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 12,780</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 12,779</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 1</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>This counted backward from Cycle 1, brings us again to a Cycle 13 as
  the name of the first cycle in the Maya conception of time. In other
  words, the Maya conceived time to have commenced, in so far as we can
  judge from the single record available, with a Cycle 13, not with the
  beginning of a Cycle 1, as they did their chronology.</p>

  <p>We have still to explain A1, figure <a href="#fig60">60</a>. This
  glyph is quite clearly a form of the Initial-series introducing glyph, as
  already explained, in which the five components of that glyph are present
  in usual form: (1) Trinal superfix; (2) pair of comb-like lateral
  appendages; (3) the tun sign; (4) the trinal subfix; (5) the variable
  central element, here represented by a grotesque head.</p>

  <p>Of these, the first only claims our attention here. The trinal
  superfix in A1 (fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>), as its name signifies, is
  composed of three parts, but, unlike other forms of this element, the
  middle part seems to be nothing more nor less than a numerical dot or 1.
  The question at once arises, can the two flanking parts be merely
  ornamental and the whole element stand for the number 1? The introducing
  glyph at the beginning of this text (not figured here), so far as it can
  be made out, has a trinal superfix of exactly the same character&mdash;a
  dot with an ornamental scroll on each side. What can be the explanation
  of this element, and indeed of the whole glyph? Is it one
  great-great-great-great cycle&mdash;a period twenty times as great as the
  one recorded in A2, or is it not a term of the series in glyphs A2-A9?
  <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>The writer believes that whatever it may
  be, it is at least <i>not</i> a member of this series, and in support of
  his belief he suggests that if it were, why should it alone be retained
  in recording <i>all</i> Initial-series dates, whereas the other
  three&mdash;the great-great-great cycle, the great-great cycle, and the
  great-cycle signs&mdash;have disappeared.</p>

  <p>The following explanation, the writer believes, satisfactorily
  accounts for all of these points, though it is advanced here only by way
  of suggestion as a possible solution of the meaning of the Initial-series
  introducing glyph. It is suggested that in A1 we may have a sign
  representing "eternity," "this world," "time"; that is to say, a sign
  denoting the duration of the present world-epoch, the epoch of which the
  Maya civilization occupied only a small part. The middle dot of the upper
  element, being 1, denotes that this world-epoch is the first, or present,
  one, and the whole glyph itself might mean "the present world." The
  appropriateness of such a glyph ushering in every Initial-series date is
  apparent. It signified time in general, while the succeeding 7 glyphs
  denoted what particular day of time was designated in the
  inscription.</p>

  <p>But why, even admitting the correctness of this interpretation of A1,
  should the great-great-great cycle, the great-great cycle, and the great
  cycle of their chronological scheme be omitted, and Initial-series dates
  always open with this glyph, which signifies time in general, followed by
  the current cycle? The answer to this question, the writer believes, is
  that the cycle was the greatest period with which the Maya could have had
  actual experience. It will be shown in Chapter V that there are a few
  Cycle-8 dates actually recorded, as well as a half a dozen Cycle-10
  dates. That is, the cycle, which changed its coefficient every 400 years,
  was a period which they could <i>not</i> regard as never changing within
  the range of human experience. On the other hand, it was the shortest
  period of which they were uncertain, since the great cycle could change
  its coefficient only every 8,000 years&mdash;practically eternity so far
  as the Maya were concerned. Therefore it could be omitted as well as the
  two higher periods in a date without giving rise to confusion as to which
  great cycle was the current one. The cycle, on the contrary, had to be
  given, as its coefficient changed every 400 years, and the Maya are known
  to have recorded dates in at least three cycles&mdash;Nos. 8, 9, and 10.
  Hence, it was Great Cycle 19 for 8,000 years, Great-great Cycle 11 for
  160,000, and Great-great-great Cycle 1 for 3,200,000 years, whereas it
  was Cycle 9 for only 400 years. This, not the fact that the Maya never
  had a period higher than the cycle, the writer believes was the reason
  why the three higher periods were omitted from Initial-series
  dates&mdash;they were unnecessary so far as accuracy was concerned, since
  there could never be any doubt concerning them. <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span></p>

  <p>It is not necessary to press this point further, though it is believed
  the foregoing conception of time had actually been worked out by the
  Maya. The archaic date recorded by Stela 10 at Tikal (9.3.6.2.0) makes
  this monument one of the very oldest in the Maya territory; indeed, there
  is only one other stela which has an earlier Initial Series, Stela 3 at
  Tikal. In the archaic period from which this monument dates the middle
  dot of the trinal superfix in the Initial-series introducing glyph may
  still have retained its numerical value, 1, but in later times this
  middle dot lost its numerical characteristics and frequently appears as a
  scroll itself.</p>

  <p>The early date of Stela 10 makes it not unlikely that this process of
  glyph elaboration may not have set in at the time it was erected, and
  consequently that we have in this simplified trinal element the genesis
  of the later elaborated form; and, finally, that A1, figure <a
  href="#fig60">60</a>, may have meant "the present world-epoch" or
  something similar.</p>

  <p>In concluding the presentation of these three numbers the writer may
  express the opinion that a careful study of the period glyphs in figures
  <a href="#fig58">58</a>-<a href="#fig60">60</a> will lead to the
  following conclusions: (1) That the six periods recorded in the first,
  the seven in the second, and the eight or nine in the third, all belong
  to the same series in each case; and (2) that throughout the six terms of
  the first, the seven of the second, and the eight of the third, the
  series in each case conforms strictly to the vigesimal system of
  numeration given in Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.</p>

  <p>As mentioned on page <a href="#page116">116</a> (footnote 2), in this
  method of recording the higher numbers the kin sign may sometimes be
  omitted without affecting the numerical value of the series wherein the
  omission occurs. In such cases the coefficient of the kin sign is usually
  prefixed to the uinal sign, the coefficient of the uinal itself standing
  above the uinal sign. In figure <a href="#fig58">58</a>, for example, the
  uinal and the kin coefficients are both 0. In this case, however, the 0
  on the left of the uinal sign is to be understood as belonging to the kin
  sign, which is omitted, while the 0 above the uinal sign is the uinal's
  own coefficient 0. Again in figure <a href="#fig59">59</a>, the kin sign
  is omitted and the kin coefficient 1 is prefixed to the uinal sign, while
  the uinal's own coefficient 12 stands above the uinal sign. Similarly,
  the 12 uinals and 17 kins recorded in figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>,
  <i>d</i>, might as well have been written as in <i>o</i> of the same
  figure, that is, with the kin sign omitted and its coefficient 17
  prefixed to the uinal sign, while the uinal's own coefficient 12 appears
  above. Or again, the 9 uinals and 18 kins recorded in <i>f</i> also might
  have been written as in <i>p</i>, that is, with the kin sign omitted and
  the kin coefficient 18 prefixed to the uinal sign while the uinal's own
  coefficient 9 appears above.</p>

  <p>In all the above examples the coefficients of the omitted kin signs
  are on the <i>left</i> of the uinal signs, while the uinal coefficients
  are <i>above</i> the uinal signs. Sometimes, however, these positions are
  reversed, <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>and the uinal coefficient stands <i>on the
  left</i> of the uinal sign, while the kin coefficient stands
  <i>above</i>. This interchange in certain cases probably resulted from
  the needs of glyphic balance and symmetry. For example, in figure <a
  href="#fig62">62</a>, <i>a</i>, had the kin coefficient 19 been placed on
  the left of the uinal sign, the uinal coefficient 4 would have been
  insufficient to fill the space above the period glyph, and consequently
  the corner of the glyph block would have appeared ragged. The use of the
  19 <i>above</i> and the 4 to the left, on the other hand, properly fills
  this space, making a symmetrical glyph. Such cases, however, are unusual,
  and the customary position of the kin coefficient, when the kin sign is
  omitted, is on the left of the uinal sign, not above it. This practice,
  namely, omitting the kin sign in numerical series, seems to have
  prevailed extensively in connection with both Initial Series and
  Secondary Series; indeed, in the latter it is the rule to which there are
  but few exceptions.</p>

    <i>b</i>, Altar U, Copan; <i>c</i>, Stela J, Copan.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The omission of the kin sign, while by far the most common, is not the
  only example of glyph omission found in numerical series in the
  inscriptions. Sometimes, though very rarely, numbers occur in which
  periods other than the kin are wanting. A case in point is figure <a
  href="#fig62">62</a>, <i>b</i>. Here a tun sign appears with the
  coefficient 13 above and 3 to the left. Since there are only two
  coefficients (13 and 3) and three time periods (tun, uinal, and kin), it
  is clear that the signs of both the lower periods have been omitted as
  well as the coefficient of one of them. In <i>c</i> of the last-mentioned
  figure a somewhat different practice was followed. Here, although three
  time periods are recorded&mdash;tuns, uinals and kins&mdash;one period
  (the uinal) and its coefficient have been omitted, and there is nothing
  between the 0 kins and 10 tuns. Such cases are exceedingly rare, however,
  and may be disregarded by the beginner.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the order of the periods in the numbers in figure <a
  href="#fig56">56</a> was just the reverse of that in the numbers shown in
  figures <a href="#fig58">58</a> and <a href="#fig59">59</a>; that in one
  place the kins stand at the top and in the other at the bottom; and
  finally, that this difference was not a vital one, since it had no effect
  on the values of the numbers. This is true, because in the first method
  of expressing the higher numbers, it matters not which end of the number
  comes first, the highest or the <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>lowest period, so long as its several
  periods always stand in the same relation to each other. For example, in
  figure <a href="#fig56">56</a>, <i>q</i>, 6 cycles, 17 katuns, 2 tuns, 10
  uinals, and 0 kins represent exactly the same number as 0 kins, 10
  uinals, 2 tuns, 17 katuns, and 6 cycles; that is, with the lowest term
  first.</p>

  <p>It was explained on page <a href="#page23">23</a> that the order in
  which the glyphs are to be read is from top to bottom and from left to
  right. Applying this rule to the inscriptions, the student will find that
  all Initial Series are descending series; that in reading from top to
  bottom and left to right, the cycles will be encountered first, the
  katuns next, the tuns next, the uinals, and the kins last. Moreover, it
  will be found also that the great majority of Secondary Series are
  ascending series, that is, in reading from top to bottom and left to
  right, the kins will be encountered first, the uinals next, the tuns
  next, the katuns next, and the cycles last. The reason why Initial Series
  always should be presented as descending series, and Secondary Series
  usually as ascending series is unknown; though as stated above, the order
  in either case might have been reversed without affecting in any way the
  numerical value of either series.</p>

  <p>This concludes the discussion of the first method of expressing the
  higher numbers, the only method which has been found in the
  inscriptions.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Second Method of Numeration</span></p>

  <p>The other method by means of which the Maya expressed their higher
  numbers (the second method given on p. <a href="#page103">103</a>) may be
  called "numeration by position," since in this method the numerical value
  of the symbols depended solely on position, just as in our own decimal
  system, in which the value of a figure depends on its distance from the
  decimal point, whole numbers being written to the left and fractions to
  the right. The ratio of increase, as the word "decimal" implies, is 10
  throughout, and the numerical values of the consecutive positions
  increase as they recede from the decimal point in each direction,
  according to the terms of a geometrical progression. For example, in the
  number 8888.0, the second 8 from the decimal point, counting from right
  to left, has a value ten times greater than the first 8, since it stands
  for 8 tens (80); the third 8 from the decimal point similarly has a value
  ten times greater than the second 8, since it stands for 8 hundreds
  (800); finally, the fourth 8 has a value ten times greater than the third
  8, since it stands for 8 thousands (8,000). Hence, although the figures
  used are the same in each case, each has a different numerical value,
  depending solely upon its position with reference to the decimal
  point.</p>

  <p>In the second method of writing their numbers the Maya had devised a
  somewhat similar notation. Their ratio of increase was 20 in all
  positions except the third. The value of these positions increased <!--
  Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span>with
  their distance from the bottom, according to the terms of the vigesimal
  system shown in Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>. This second method,
  or "numeration by position," as it may be called, was a distinct advance
  over the first, since it required for its expression only the signs for
  the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, and did not involve the use of any
  period glyphs, as did the first method. To its greater brevity, no doubt,
  may be ascribed its use in the codices, where numerical calculations
  running into numbers of 5 and 6 terms form a large part of the subject
  matter. It should be remembered that in numeration by position only the
  normal forms of the numbers&mdash;bar and dot numerals&mdash;are used.
  This probably results from the fact that head-variant numerals never
  occur independently, but are always prefixed to some other glyph, as
  period, day, or month signs (see p. <a href="#page104">104</a>). Since no
  period glyphs are used in numeration by position, only normal-form
  numerals, that is, bar and dot numerals, can appear.</p>

  <p>The numbers from 1 to 19, inclusive, are expressed in this method, as
  shown in figure <a href="#fig39">39</a>, and the number 0 as shown in
  figure <a href="#fig46">46</a>. As all of these numbers are below 20,
  they are expressed as units of the first place or order, and consequently
  each should be regarded as having been multiplied by 1, the numerical
  value of the first or lowest position.</p>

  <p>The number 20 was expressed in two different ways: (1) By the sign
  shown in figure <a href="#fig45">45</a>; and (2) by the numeral 0 in the
  bottom place and the numeral 1 in the next place above it, as in figure
  <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>a</i>. The first of these had only a very
  restricted use in connection with the tonalamatl, wherein numeration by
  position was impossible, and therefore a special character for 20 (see
  fig. <a href="#fig45">45</a>) was necessary. See Chapter VI.</p>

  <p>The numbers from 21 to 359, inclusive, involved the use of two
  places&mdash;the kin place and the uinal place&mdash;which, according to
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>, we saw had numerical values of 1 and
  20, respectively. For example, the number 37 was expressed as shown in
  figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>b</i>. The 17 in the kin place has a
  value of 17 (17 × 1) and the 1 in the uinal, or second, place a value of
  20 (1 (the numeral) × 20 (the fixed numerical value of the second
  place)). The sum of these two products equals 37. Again, 300 was written
  as in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>c</i>. The 0 in the kin place
  has the value 0 (0 × 1), and the 15 in the second place has the value of
  300 (15 × 20), and the sum of these products equals 300.</p>

  <p>To express the numbers 360 to 7,199, inclusive, three places or terms
  were necessary&mdash;kins, uinals, and tuns&mdash;of which the last had a
  numerical value of 360. (See Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.) For
  example, the number 360 is shown in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>,
  <i>d</i>. The 0 in the lowest place indicates that 0 kins are involved,
  the 0 in the second place indicates that 0 uinals or 20's are involved,
  while the 1 in the third place shows that there is 1 tun, or 360, kins
  recorded (1 (the numeral) × 360 (the fixed numerical value of the third
  position)); the sum of these three products equals 360. Again, the number
  7,113 is expressed as shown in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>e</i>.
  <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>The 13 in the lowest place equals 13 (13 ×
  1); the 13 in the second place, 260 (13 × 20); and the 19 in the third
  place, 6,840 (19 × 360). The sum of these three products equals 7,113 (13
  + 260 + 6,840),</p>

  <p>The numbers from 7,200 to 143,999, inclusive, involved the use of four
  places or terms&mdash;kins, uinals, tuns, and katuns&mdash;the last of
  which (the fourth place) had a numerical value of 7,200. (See Table <a
  href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.) For example, the number 7,202 is recorded in
  figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>f</i>. <!-- Page 132 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>{132}</span>The 2 in the first
  place equals 2 (2×1); the 0 in the second place, 0 (0×20); the 0 in the
  third place, 0 (0×360); and the 1 in the fourth place, 7,200 (1×7,200).
  The sum of these four products equals 7,202 (2+0+0+7,200). Again, the
  number 100,932 is recorded in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>g</i>.
  Here the 12 in the first place equals 12 (12×1); the 6 in the second
  place, 120 (6×20); the 0 in the third place, 0 (0×360); and the 14 in the
  fourth place, 100,800 (14×7,200). The sum of these four products equals
  100,932 (12+120+0+100,800).</p>

  <p>The numbers from 144,000 to 2,879,999, inclusive, involved the use of
  five places or terms&mdash;kins, uinals, tuns, katuns, and cycles. The
  last of these (the fifth place) had a numerical value of 144,000. (See
  Table <a href="#tableVIII">VIII</a>.) For example, the number 169,200 is
  recorded in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>h</i>. The 0 in the first
  place equals 0 (0×1); the 0 in the second place, 0 (0×20); the 10 in the
  third place, 3,600 (10×360); the 3 in the fourth place, 21,600 (3×7,200);
  and the 1 in the fifth place, 144,000 (1×144,000). The sum of these five
  products equals 169,200 (0+0+3,600+21,600+144,000). Again, the number
  2,577,301 is recorded in figure <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>i</i>. The 1
  in the first place equals 1 (1×1); the 3 in the second place, 60 (3×20);
  the 19 in the third place, 6,840 (19×360); the 17 in the fourth place,
  122,400 (17×7,200); and the 17 in the fifth place, 2,448,000
  (17x144,000). The sum of these five products equals 2,577,301
  (1+60+6,480+122,400+2,448,000).</p>

  <p>The writing of numbers above 2,880,000 up to and including 12,489,781
  (the highest number found in the codices) involves the use of six places,
  or terms&mdash;kins, uinals, tuns, katuns, cycles, and great
  cycles&mdash;the last of which (the sixth place) has the numerical value
  2,880,000. It will be remembered that some have held that the sixth place
  in the inscriptions contained only 13 units of the fifth place, or
  1,872,000 units of the first place. In the codices, however, there are
  numerous calendric checks which prove conclusively that in so far as the
  codices are concerned the sixth place was composed of 20 units of the
  fifth place. For example, the number 5,832,060 is expressed as in figure
  <a href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>j</i>. The 0 in the first place equals 0
  (0×1); the 3 in the second place, 60 (3×20); the 0 in the third place, 0
  (0×360); the 10 in the fourth place, 72,000 (10×7,200); the 0 in the
  fifth place, 0 (0×144,000); and the 2 in the sixth place, 5,760,000
  (2×2,880,000). The sum of these six terms equals 5,832,060
  (0+60+0+72,000+0+5,760,000). The highest number in the codices, as
  explained above, is 12,489,781, which is recorded on page 61 of the
  Dresden Codex. This number is expressed as in figure <a
  href="#fig63">63</a>, <i>k</i>. The 1 in the first place equals 1 (1×1);
  the 15 in the second place, 300 (15×20); the 13 in the third place, 4,680
  (13×360); the 14 in the fourth place, 100,800 (14×7,200); the 6 in the
  fifth place, 864,000 (6×144,000); and the 4 in the sixth place,
  11,520,000 (4×2,880,000). The sum of these six products equals 12,489,781
  (1+300+4,680+100,800+864,000+11,520,000). <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span></p>

  <p>It is clear that in numeration by position the order of the units
  could not be reversed as in the first method without seriously affecting
  their numerical values. This must be true, since in the second method the
  numerical values of the numerals depend entirely on their
  position&mdash;that is, on their distance above the bottom or first term.
  In the first method, the multiplicands&mdash;the period glyphs, each of
  which had a fixed numerical value&mdash;are always expressed<a
  name="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> with their corresponding
  multipliers&mdash;the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive; in other words, the
  period glyphs themselves show whether the series is an ascending or a
  descending one. But in the second method the multiplicands are not
  expressed. Consequently, since there is nothing about a column of bar and
  dot numerals which in itself indicates whether the series is an ascending
  or a descending one, and since in numeration by position a fixed starting
  point is absolutely essential, in their second method the Maya were
  obliged not only to fix arbitrarily the direction of reading, as from
  bottom to top, but also to confine themselves exclusively to the
  presentation of one kind of series only&mdash;that is, ascending series.
  Only by means of these two arbitrary rules was confusion obviated in
  numeration by position.</p>

  <p>However dissimilar these two methods of representing the numbers may
  appear at first sight, fundamentally they are the same, since both have
  as their basis the same vigesimal system of numeration. Indeed, it can
  not be too strongly emphasized that throughout the range of the Maya
  writings, codices, inscriptions, or Books of Chilam Balam<a name="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> the several methods of counting time
  and recording events found in each are all derived from the same source,
  and all are expressions of the same numerical system.</p>

  two methods they are here contrasted:</p>

  <p>We have seen in the foregoing pages (1) how the Maya wrote their 20
  <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span>numerals, and (2) how these numerals were
  used to express the higher numbers. The next question which concerns us
  is, How did they use these numbers in their calculations; or in other
  words, how was their arithmetic applied to their calendar? It may be said
  at the very outset in answer to this question, that in so far as known,
  <i>numbers appear to have had but one use throughout the Maya texts,
  namely, to express the time elapsing between dates</i>.<a name="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> In the codices and the inscriptions
  alike all the numbers whose use is understood have been found to deal
  exclusively with the counting of time.</p>

  <p>This highly specialized use of the numbers in Maya texts has
  determined the first step to be taken in the process of deciphering them.
  Since the primary unit of the calendar was the day, all numbers should be
  reduced to terms of this unit, or in other words, to units of the first
  order, or place.<a name="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> Hence,
  we may accept the following as the <i>first step</i> in ascertaining the
  meaning of any number:</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">First Step in Solving Maya Numbers</span></p>

  <p>Reduce all the units of the higher orders to units of its first, or
  lowest, order, and then add the resulting quantities together.</p>

  <p>The application of this rule to any Maya number, no matter of how many
  terms, will always give the actual number of primary units which it
  contains, and in this form it can be more conveniently utilized in
  connection with the calendar than if it were left as recorded, that is,
  in terms of its higher orders.</p>

  <p>The reduction of units of the higher orders to units of the first
  order has been explained on pages <a href="#page105">105</a>-<a
  href="#page133">133</a>, but in order to provide the student with this
  same information in a more condensed and accessible form, it is presented
  in the following tables, of which Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a> is
  to be used for reducing numbers to their primary units in the
  inscriptions, and Table <a href="#tableXIV">XIV</a> for the same purpose

  <p>It should be remembered, in using these tables, that each of the signs
  for the periods therein given has its own particular numerical value, and
  that this value in each case is a multiplicand which is to be multiplied
  by the numeral attached to it (not shown in Table <a
  href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>). For example, a 3 attached to the katun sign
  reduces to 21,600 units of the first order (3×7,200). Again, 5 attached
  to the uinal sign reduces to 100 units of the first order (5×20). In
  using Table <a href="#tableXIV">XIV</a>, however, it should be remembered
  that the position of a numeral multiplier determines at the same time
  that multiplier's multiplicand. Thus a 5 in the third place indicates
  that the 5's multiplicand is 360, the numerical value of the third place,
  and such a term reduces to 1,800 units of the first place (5×360=1,800).
  Again, a 10 in the fourth place indicates that the 10's multiplicand is
  7,200, the numerical value corresponding to the fourth place, and such a
  term reduces to 72,000 units of the first place.</p>

  <p>Having reduced all the terms of a number to units of the 1st order,
  the next step in finding out its meaning is to discover the date from
  which it is counted. This operation gives rise to the <i>second
  step</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Second Step in Solving Maya Numbers</span></p>

  <p>Find the date from which the number is counted:</p>

  <p>This is not always an easy matter, since the dates from which Maya
  numbers are counted are frequently not expressed in the texts;
  consequently, it is clear that no single rule can be formulated which
  will cover all cases. There are, however, two general rules which will be
  found to apply to the great majority of numbers in the texts:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> When the starting point or date is expressed, usually,
  though not invariably, it precedes<a name="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> the number counted from it.</p>

  <p>It should be noted, however, in connection with this rule, that the
  starting date hardly ever immediately precedes the number from which it
  is counted, but that several glyphs nearly always stand <!-- Page 136
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>between.<a
  name="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> Certain exceptions to the
  above rule are by no means rare, and the student must be continually on
  the lookout for such reversals of the regular order. These exceptions are
  cases in which the starting date (1) follows the number counted from it,
  and (2) stands elsewhere in the text, entirely disassociated from, and
  unattached to, the number counted from it.</p>

  <p>The second of the above-mentioned general rules, covering the majority
  of cases, follows:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 2</i>. When the starting point or date is not expressed, if
  the number is an Initial Series the date from which it should be counted
  will be found to be <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.<a name="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This rule is particularly useful in deciphering numbers in the
  inscriptions. For example, when the student finds a number which he can
  identify as an Initial Series,<a name="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> he may assume at once that such a
  number in all probability is counted from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>,
  and proceed on this assumption. The exceptions to this rule, that is,
  cases in which the starting point is not expressed and the number is not
  an Initial Series, are not numerous. No rule can be given covering all
  such cases, and the starting points of such numbers can be determined
  only by means of the calculations given under the third and fourth steps,
  below.</p>

  <p>Having determined the starting point or date from which a given number
  is to be counted (if this is possible), the next step is to find out
  which way the count runs; that is, whether it is <i>forward</i> from the
  starting point to some <i>later date</i>, or whether it is
  <i>backward</i> from the starting point to some <i>earlier date</i>. This
  process may be called the <i>third step</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Third Step in Solving Maya Numbers</span></p>

  <p>Ascertain whether the number is to be counted forward or backward from
  its starting point.</p>

  <p>It may be said at the very outset in this connection that the
  overwhelming majority of Maya numbers are counted <i>forward</i> from
  their starting points and not backward. In other words, they proceed from
  <i>earlier to later dates</i> and not vice versa. Indeed, the
  preponderance of the former is so great, and the exceptions are so rare,
  that the student should always proceed on the postulate that the count is
  forward until proved definitely to be otherwise. <!-- Page 137 --><span

    showing the use of the "minus" or "backward" sign in the codices.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the codices, moreover, when the count is backward, or contrary to
  the general practice, the fact is clearly indicated<a name="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> by a special character. This character,
  although attached only to the lowest term<a name="NtA_96"
  href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> of the number which is to be counted
  backward, is to be interpreted as applying to all the other terms as
  well, its effect extending to the number as a whole. This "backward sign"
  (shown in fig. <a href="#fig64">64</a>) is a circle drawn in red around
  the lowest term of the number which it affects, and is surmounted by a
  knot of the same color. An example covering the use of this sign is given
  in figure <a href="#fig64">64</a>. Although the "backward sign" in this
  figure surrounds only the numeral in the first place, 0, it is to be
  interpreted, as we have seen, as applying to the 2 in the second place
  and the 6 in the third place. This number, expressed as 6 tuns, 2 uinals,
  and 0 kins, reduces to 2,200 units of the first place, and in this form
  may be more readily handled (first step). Since the starting point
  usually precedes the number counted from it and since in figure <a
  href="#fig64">64</a> the number is expressed by the second method, its
  starting point will be found standing below it. This follows from the
  fact that in numeration by position the order is from bottom to top.
  Therefore the starting point from which the 2,200 recorded in figure <a
  href="#fig64">64</a> is counted will be found to be below it, that is,
  the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b><a name="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> (second step). Finally, the red circle
  and knot surrounding the lowest (0) term of this 2,200 indicates that
  this number is to be counted <i>backward</i> from its starting point, not
  forward (third step).</p>

  <p>On the other hand, in the inscriptions no special character seems to
  have been used with a number to indicate that it was to be counted
  backward; at least no such sign has yet been discovered. In the
  inscriptions, therefore, with the single exception<a name="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> mentioned below, the student can only
  apply the general rule given on page <a href="#page136">136</a>, that in
  the great majority of cases the count is forward. This rule will be found
  to apply to at least nine out of every ten numbers. The exception above
  noted, that is, where the practice is so uniform as to render possible
  the formulation of an unfailing rule, has to do with Initial Series. This
  rule, to which there are no known exceptions, may be stated as
  follows:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1</i>. In Initial Series the count is <i>always forward</i>,
  and, in general throughout the inscriptions. The very few cases in which
  the count <i>is</i> backward, are confined chiefly to Secondary Series,
  and it is in <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>dealing with this kind of series that the
  student will find the greatest number of exceptions to the general
  rule.</p>

  <p>Having determined the direction of the count, whether it is forward or
  backward, the next (<i>fourth</i>) step may be given.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Fourth Step in Solving Maya Numbers</span></p>

  <p>To count the number from its starting point.</p>

  <p>We have come now to a step that involves the consideration of actual
  arithmetical processes, which it is thought can be set forth much more
  clearly by the use of specific examples than by the statement of general
  rules. Hence, we will formulate our rules after the processes which they
  govern have been fully explained.</p>

  <p>In counting any number, as 31,741, or 4.8.3.1 as it would be expressed
  in Maya notation,<a name="NtA_99" href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> from
  any date, as <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, there are four unknown elements which
  have to be determined before we can write the date which the count
  reaches. These are:</p>

  <p>1. The day coefficient, which must be one of the numerals 1 to 13,
  inclusive.</p>

  <p>2. The day name, which must be one of the twenty given in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a>.</p>

  <p>3. The position of the day in some division of the year, which must be
  one of the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive.</p>

  <p>4. The name of the division of the year, which must be one of the
  nineteen given in Table <a href="#tableIII">III</a>.</p>

  <p>These four unknown elements all have to be determined from (1) the
  starting date, and (2) the number which is to be counted from it.</p>

  <p>If the student will constantly bear in mind that all Maya sequences,
  whether the day coefficients, day signs, positions in the divisions of
  the year, or what not, are absolutely continuous, repeating themselves
  without any break or interruption whatsoever, he will better understand
  the calculations which follow.</p>

  <p>It was explained in the text (see pp. <a href="#page41">41</a>-<a
  href="#page44">44</a>) and also shown graphically in the tonalamatl wheel
  (pl. <a href="#plate5">5</a>) that after the day coefficients had reached
  the number 13 they returned to 1, following each other indefinitely in
  this order without interruption. It is clear, therefore, that the highest
  multiple of 13 which the given number contains may be subtracted from it
  without affecting in any way the value of the day coefficient of the date
  which the number will reach when counted from the starting point. This is
  true, because no matter what the day coefficient of the starting point
  may be, any multiple of 13 will always bring the count back to the same
  day coefficient. <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span></p>

  <p>Taking up the number, 31,741, which we have chosen for our first
  example, let us deduct from it the highest multiple of 13 which it
  contains. This will be found by dividing the number by 13, and
  multiplying the <i>whole-number part</i> of the resulting quotient by 13:
  31,741 ÷ 13 = 2,441<span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">13</span>. Multiplying 2,441 by 13, we have 31,733, which is
  the highest multiple of 13 that 31,741 contains; consequently it may be
  deducted from 31,741 without affecting the value of the resulting day
  coefficient: 31,741 <span class="nw">-</span> 31,733 = 8. In the example
  under consideration, therefore, 8 is the number which, if counted from
  the day coefficient of the starting point, will give the day coefficient
  of the resulting date. In other words, after dividing by 13 the only part
  of the resulting quotient which is used in determining the new day
  coefficient is the <i>numerator</i> of the fractional part.<a
  name="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> Hence the following
  rule for determining the first unknown on page <a href="#page138">138</a>
  (the day coefficient):</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> To find the new day coefficient divide the given number
  by 13, and count forward the numerator of the fractional part of the
  resulting quotient from the starting point if the count is forward, and
  backward if the count is backward, deducting 13 in either case from the
  resulting number if it should exceed 13.</p>

  <p>Applying this rule to 31,741, we have seen above that its division by
  13 gives as the fractional part of the quotient <span
  class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">13</span>. Assuming that the
  count is forward from the starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, if 8
  (the numerator of the fractional part of the quotient) be counted forward
  from 4, the day coefficient of the starting point (<b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>), the day coefficient of the resulting date will be 12 (4 + 8).
  Since this number is below 13, the last sentence of the above rule has no
  application in this case. In counting forward 31,741 from the date <b>4
  Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, therefore, the day coefficient of the resulting date
  will be 12; thus we have determined our first unknown. Let us next find
  the second unknown, the day sign to which this 12 is prefixed.</p>

  <p>It was explained on page <a href="#page37">37</a> that the twenty day
  signs given in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> succeed one another in
  endless rotation, the first following immediately the twentieth no matter
  which one of the twenty was chosen as the first. Consequently, it is
  clear that the highest multiple of 20 which the given number contains may
  be deducted from it without affecting in any way the name of the day sign
  of the date which the number will reach when counted from the starting
  point. This is true because, no matter what the day sign of the starting
  point may be, any multiple of 20 will always bring the count back to the
  same day sign. <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span></p>

  <p>Returning to the number 31,741, let us deduct from it the highest
  multiple of 20 which it contains, found by dividing the number by 20 and
  multiplying the whole number part of the resulting quotient by 20; 31,741
  ÷ 20 = 1,587<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>.
  Multiplying 1,587 by 20, we have 31,740, which is the highest multiple of
  20 that 31,741 contains, and which may be deducted from 31,741 without
  affecting the resulting day sign; 31,741 <span class="nw">-</span> 31,740
  = 1. Therefore in the present example 1 is the number which, if counted
  forward from the day sign of the starting point in the sequence of the 20
  day signs given in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, will reach the day sign
  of the resulting date. In other words, after dividing by 20 the only part
  of the resulting quotient which is used in determining the new day sign
  is the numerator of the fractional part. Thus we may formulate the rule
  for determining the second unknown on page <a href="#page138">138</a>
  (the day sign):</p>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> To find the new day sign, divide the given number by
  20, and count forward the numerator of the fractional part of the
  resulting quotient from the starting point in the sequence of the twenty
  day signs given in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, if the count is
  forward, and backward if the count is backward, and the sign reached will
  be the new day sign.</p>

  <p>Applying this rule to 31,741, we have seen above that its division by
  20 gives us as the fractional part of the quotient, <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>. Since the count
  was forward from the starting point, if 1 (the numerator of the
  fractional part of the quotient) be counted forward in the sequence of
  the 20 day signs in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> from the day sign of
  the starting point, <b>Ahau</b> (<b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>), the day sign
  reached will be the day sign of the resulting date. Counting forward 1
  from <b>Ahau</b> in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, the day sign
  <b>Imix</b> is reached, and <b>Imix</b>, therefore, will be the new day
  sign. Thus our second unknown is determined.</p>

  <p>By combining the above two values, the 12 for the first unknown and
  <b>Imix</b> for the second, we can now say that in counting forward
  31,741 from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the day reached will be <b>12
  Imix</b>. It remains to find what position this particular day occupied
  in the 365-day year, or haab, and thus to determine the third and fourth
  unknowns on page <a href="#page138">138</a>. Both of these may be found
  at one time by the same operation.</p>

  <p>It was explained on pages <a href="#page44">44</a>-<a
  href="#page51">51</a> that the Maya year, at least in so far as the
  calendar was concerned, contained only 365 days, divided into 18 uinals
  of 20 days each, and the <i>xma kaba kin</i> of 5 days; and further, that
  when the last position in the last division of the year (<b>4 Uayeb</b>)
  was reached, it was followed without interruption by the first position
  of the first division of the next year (<b>0 Pop</b>); and, finally, that
  this sequence was continued indefinitely. Consequently it is clear that
  the highest multiple of 365 which the given number contains may be
  subtracted from it without affecting in any way the position in the year
  of the day which the number will reach when <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>counted from the
  starting point. This is true, because no matter what position in the year
  the day of the starting point may occupy, any multiple of 365 will bring
  the count back again to the same position in the year.</p>

  <p>Returning again to the number 31,741, let us deduct from it the
  highest multiple of 365 which it contains. This will be found by dividing
  the number by 365 and multiplying the whole number part of the resulting
  quotient by 365: 31,741 ÷ 365 = 86<span
  class="spp">351</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">365</span>. Multiplying 86
  by 365, we have 31,390, which is the highest multiple that 31,741
  contains. Hence it may be deducted from 31,741 without affecting the
  position in the year of the resulting day; 31,741 <span
  class="nw">-</span> 31,390 = 351. Therefore, in the present example, 351
  is the number which, if counted forward from the year position of the
  starting date in the sequence of the 365 positions in the year, given in
  Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>, will reach the position in the year of
  the day of the resulting date. This enables us to formulate the rule for
  determining the third and fourth unknowns on page <a
  href="#page138">138</a> (the position in the year of the day of the
  resulting date):</p>

  <p><i>Rule 3.</i> To find the position in the year of the new day, divide
  the given number by 365 and count forward the numerator of the fractional
  part of the resulting quotient from the year position of the starting
  point in the sequence of the 365 positions of the year shown in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a>, if the count is forward; and backward if the
  count is backward, and the position reached will be the position in the
  year which the day of the resulting date will occupy.</p>

  <p>Applying this rule to the number 31,741, we have seen above that its
  division by 365 gives 351 as the numerator of the fractional part of its
  quotient. Assuming that the count is forward from the starting point, it
  will be necessary, therefore, to count 351 forward in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a> from the position <b>8 Cumhu</b>, the position of
  the day of the starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>A glance at the month of <b>Cumhu</b> in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a> shows that after the position <b>8 Cumhu</b> there
  are 11 positions in that month; adding to these the 5 in <b>Uayeb</b>,
  the last division of the year, there will be in all 16 more positions
  before the first of the next year. Subtracting these from 351, the total
  number to be counted forward, there remains the number 335 (351-16),
  which must be counted forward in Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a> from the
  beginning of the year. Since each of the months has 20 positions, it is
  clear that 16 months will be used before the month is reached in which
  will fall the 335th position from the beginning of the year. In other
  words, 320 positions of our 335 will exactly use up all the positions of
  the first 16 months, namely, <b>Pop</b>, <b>Uo</b>, <b>Zip</b>,
  <b>Zotz</b>, <b>Tzec</b>, <b>Xul</b>, <b>Yaxkin</b>, <b>Mol</b>,
  <b>Chen</b>, <b>Yax</b>, <b>Zac</b>, <b>Ceh</b>, <b>Mac</b>,
  <b>Kankin</b>, <b>Muan</b>, <b>Pax</b>, and will bring us to the
  beginning of the 17th month (<b>Kayab</b>) with still 15 more positions
  to count forward. If the student will refer to this month in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a> he will see that 15 positions counted forward in
  this month will reach the position <b>14 Kayab</b>, which is also the
  position reached by counting forward 31,741 positions from the starting
  position <b>8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>Having determined values for all of the unknowns on page <a
  href="#page138">138</a>, we can now say that if the number 31,741 be
  counted forward from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the date <b>12 Imix
  14 Kayab</b> will be reached. To this latter date, i.&nbsp;e., the date
  reached by any count, the name "terminal date" has been given. The rules
  indicating the processes by means of which this terminal date is reached
  apply also to examples where the count is <i>backward</i>, not forward,
  from the starting point. In such cases, as the rules say, the only
  difference is that the numerators of the fractional parts of the
  quotients resulting from the different divisions are to be counted
  backward from the starting points, instead of forward as in the example
  above given.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to apply the rules by means of which our fourth step
  or process (see p. <a href="#page138">138</a>) may be carried out, a
  modification may sometimes be introduced which will considerably decrease
  the size of the number to be counted without affecting the values of the
  several parts of its resulting terminal date.</p>

  <p>We have seen on pages <a href="#page51">51</a>-<a
  href="#page60">60</a> that in Maya chronology there were possible only
  18,980 different dates&mdash;that is, combinations of the 260 days and
  the 365 positions of the year&mdash;and further, that any given day of
  the 260 could return to any given position of the 365 only after the
  lapse of 18,980 days, or 52 years. <!-- Page 143 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

  <p>Since the foregoing is true, it follows, that this number 18,980 or
  any multiple thereof, may be deducted from the number which is to be
  counted without affecting in any way the terminal date which the number
  will reach when counted from the starting point. It is obvious that this
  modification applies only to numbers which are above 18,980, all others
  being divided by 13, 20, and 365 directly, as indicated in rules 1, 2,
  and 3, respectively. This enables us to formulate another rule, which
  should be applied to the number to be counted before proceeding with
  rules 1, 2, and 3 above, if that number is above 18,980.</p>

  <p><i>Rule</i>. If the number to be counted is above 18,980, first deduct
  from it the highest multiple of 18,980 which it contains.</p>

  <p>This rule should be applied whenever possible, since it reduces the
  size of the number to be handled, and consequently involves fewer
  calculations.</p>

  <p>In Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a> are given 80 Calendar Rounds,
  that is, 80 multiples of 18,980, in terms of both the Maya notation and
  our own. These will be found sufficient to cover most numbers.</p>

  <p>Applying the above rule to the number 31,741, which was selected for
  our first example, it is seen by Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a> that 1
  Calendar Round, or 18,980 days, may be deducted from it; 31,741 <span
  class="nw">-</span> 18,980 = 12,761. In other words, we can count the
  number 12,761 forward (or backward had the count been backward in our
  example) from the starting point <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, and reach exactly
  the same terminal date as though we had counted forward 31,741, as in the
  first case.</p>

  <p>Mathematical proof of this point follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>12,761 ÷ 13 = 981<span class="spp">8</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">13</span><span class="gap"></span>12,761 ÷ 20 = 638<span class="spp"
  >1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span><span
  class="gap"></span>12,761 ÷ 365 = 34<span
  class="spp">351</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">365</span></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The numerators of the fractions in these three quotients are 8, 1, and
  351; these are identical with the numerators of the fractions in the
  quotients obtained by dividing 31,741 by the same divisors, those
  indicated in rules 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Consequently, if these
  three numerators be counted forward from the corresponding parts of the
  starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the resulting terms together will
  form the corresponding parts of the same terminal date, <b>12 Imix 14
  Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>Similarly it could be shown that 50,721 or 69,701 counted forward or
  backward from any starting point would both reach this same terminal
  date, since subtracting 2 Calendar Rounds, 37,960 (see Table <a
  href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), from the first, and 3 Calendar Rounds, 56,940
  (see Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), from the second, there would
  remain in each case 12,761. The student will find his calculations
  greatly facilitated if he will apply this rule whenever possible. To
  familiarize the student with the working of these rules, it is thought
  best to give several additional examples involving their use. <!-- Page

  <p>Let us count forward the number 5,799 from the starting point <b>2 Kan
  7 Tzec</b>. It is apparent at the outset that, since this number is less
  than 18,980, or 1 Calendar Round, the preliminary rule given on page <a
  href="#page143">143</a> does not apply in this case. Therefore we may
  proceed with the first rule given on page <a href="#page139">139</a>, by
  means of which the new day coefficient may be determined. Dividing the
  given number by 13 we have: 5,799 ÷ 13 = 446<span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">13</span>. Counting forward
  the numerator of the fractional part of the resulting quotient (1) from
  the day coefficient of the starting point (<b>2</b>), we reach <b>3</b>
  as the day coefficient of the terminal date.</p>

  <p>The second rule given on page <a href="#page140">140</a> tells how to
  find the day sign of the terminal date. Dividing the given number by 20,
  we have: 5,799 ÷ 20 = 289<span class="spp">19</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">20</span>. Counting forward the numerator of the fractional
  part of the resulting quotient (<b>19</b>) from the day sign of the
  starting point, <b>Kan</b>, in the sequence of the twenty-day signs given
  in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, the day sign <b>Akbal</b> will be
  reached, which will be the day sign of the terminal date. Therefore the
  day of the terminal date will be <b>3 Akbal</b>.</p>

  <p>The third rule, given on page <a href="#page141">141</a>, tells how to
  find the position which the day of the terminal date occupied in the
  365-day year. Dividing the given number by 365, we have: 5,799 ÷ 365 =
  15<span class="spp">324</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">365</span>.
  Counting forward the numerator of the fractional part of the resulting
  quotient, 324, from the year position of the starting date, <b>7
  Tzec</b>, in the sequence of the 365 year positions given in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a>, the position <b>6 Zip</b> will be reached as the
  position in the year of the day of the terminal date. The count by means
  of which the position <b>6 Zip</b> is determined is given in detail.
  After the year position of the starting point, <b>7 Tzec</b>, it requires
  12 more positions (Nos. 8-19, inclusive) before the close of that month
  (see Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>) will be reached. And after the
  close of <b>Tzec</b>, 13 uinals and the xma kaba kin must pass before the
  end of the year; 13 × 20 + 5 = 265, and 265 + 12 = 277. This latter
  number subtracted from 324, the total number of positions to be counted
  forward, will give the number of positions which remain to be counted in
  the next year following: 324 <span class="nw">-</span> 277 = 47. Counting
  forward 47 in the new year, we find that it will use up the months
  <b>Pop</b> and <b>Uo</b> (20 + 20 = 40) and extend 7 positions into the
  month <b>Zip</b>, or to <b>6 Zip</b>. Therefore, gathering together the
  values determined for the several parts of the terminal date, we may say
  that in counting forward 5,799 from the starting point <b>2 Kan 7
  Tzec</b>, the terminal date reached will be <b>3 Akbal 6 Zip</b>.</p>

  <p>For the next example let us select a much higher number, say 322,920,
  which we will assume is to be counted forward from the starting point
  <b>13 Ik 0 Zip</b>. Since this number is above 18,980, we may apply our
  preliminary rule (p. <a href="#page143">143</a>) and deduct all the
  Calendar <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>Rounds possible. By turning to Table <a
  href="#tableXVI">XVI</a> we see that 17 Calendar Rounds, or 322,660, may
  be deducted from our number: 322,920 <span class="nw">-</span> 322,660 =
  260. In other words, we can use 260 exactly as though it were 322,920.
  Dividing by 13, we have 260 ÷ 13 = 20. Since there is no fraction in the
  quotient, the numerator of the fraction will be 0, and counting 0 forward
  from the day coefficient of the starting point, <b>13</b>, we have 13 as
  the day coefficient of the terminal date (rule 1, p. <a
  href="#page139">139</a>). Dividing by 20 we have 260 ÷ 20 = 13. Since
  there is no fraction in the quotient, the numerator of the fraction will
  be 0, and counting forward 0 from the day sign of the starting point,
  <b>Ik</b> in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, the day sign <b>Ik</b> will
  remain the day sign of the terminal date (rule 2, p. <a
  href="#page140">140</a>). Combining the two values just determined, we
  see that the day of the terminal date will be <b>13 Ik</b>, or a day of
  the same name as the day of the starting point. This follows also from
  the fact that there are only 260 differently named days (see pp. <a
  href="#page41">41</a>-<a href="#page44">44</a>) and any given day will
  have to recur, therefore, after the lapse of 260 days.<a name="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> Dividing by 365 we have: 260 ÷ 365 =
  <span class="spp">260</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">365</span>. Counting
  forward the numerator of the fraction, 260, from the year position of the
  starting point, <b>0 Zip</b>, in Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>, the
  position in the year of the day of the terminal date will be found to be
  <b>0 Pax</b>. Since 260 days equal just 13 uinals, we have only to count
  forward from <b>0 Zip</b> 13 uinals in order to reach the year position;
  that is, <b>0 Zotz</b> is 1 uinal; to <b>0 Tzec</b> 2 uinals, to <b>0
  Xul</b> 3 uinals, and so on in Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a> to <b>0
  Pax</b>, which will complete the last of the 13 uinals (rule 3, p. <a
  href="#page141">141</a>).</p>

  <p>Combining the above values, we find that in counting forward 322,920
  (or 260) from the starting point <b>13 Ik 0 Zip</b>, the terminal date
  reached is <b>13 Ik 0 Pax</b>.</p>

  <p>In order to illustrate the method of procedure when the count is
  <i>backward</i>, let us assume an example of this kind. Suppose we count
  backward the number 9,663 from the starting point <b>3 Imix 4 Uayeb</b>.
  Since this number is below 18,980, no Calendar Round can be deducted from
  it. Dividing the given number by 13, we have: 9,663 ÷ 13 =743<span
  class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">13</span>. Counting the
  numerator of the fractional part of this quotient, 4, <i>backward</i>
  from the day coefficient of the starting point, <b>3</b>, we reach 12 as
  the day coefficient of the terminal date, that is, <b>2, 1, 13, 12</b>
  (rule 1, p. <a href="#page139">139</a>). Dividing the given number by 20,
  we have: 9,663 ÷ 20 = 483<span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">20</span>. Counting the numerator of the fractional part of
  this quotient, 3, <i>backward</i> from the day sign of the starting
  point, <b>Imix</b>, in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, we reach
  <b>Eznab</b> as the day sign of the terminal date (<b>Ahau, Cauac,
  Eznab</b>); consequently the day reached in the count will be <b>12
  Eznab</b>. Dividing the given number by 365, we have <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>9,663 ÷ 365 =
  26<span class="spp">173</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">365</span>.
  Counting <i>backward</i> the numerator of the fractional part of this
  quotient, 173, from the year position of the starting point, <b>4
  Uayeb</b>, the year position of the terminal date will be found to be
  <b>11 Yax</b>. Before position <b>4 Uayeb</b> (see Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a>) there are 4 positions in that division of the
  year (<b>3, 2, 1, 0</b>). Counting these <i>backward</i> to the end of
  the month <b>Cumhu</b> (see Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>), we have
  left 169 positions (173 <span class="nw">-</span> 4 = 169); this equals 8
  uinals and 9 days extra. Therefore, beginning with the end of
  <b>Cumhu</b>, we may count <i>backward</i> 8 whole uinals, namely:
  <b>Cumhu, Kayab, Pax, Muan, Kankin, Mac, Ceh</b>, and <b>Zac</b>, which
  will bring us to the end of <b>Yax</b> (since we are counting backward).
  As we have left still 9 days out of our original 173, these must be
  counted backward from position <b>0 Zac</b>, that is, beginning with
  position <b>19 Yax: 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11</b>; so <b>11
  Yax</b> is the position in the year of the day of the terminal date.
  Assembling the above values, we find that in counting the number 9,663
  <i>backward</i> from the starting point, <b>2 Imix 4 Uayeb</b>, the
  terminal date is <b>12 Eznab 11 Yax</b>. Whether the count be forward or
  backward, the method is the same, the only difference being in the
  direction of the counting.</p>

  <p>This concludes the discussion of the actual arithmetical processes
  involved in counting forward or backward any given number from any given
  date; however, before explaining the fifth and final step in deciphering
  the Maya numbers, it is first necessary to show how this method of
  counting was applied to the Long Count.</p>

  <p>The numbers used above in connection with dates merely express the
  difference in time between starting points and terminal dates, without
  assigning either set of dates to their proper positions in Maya
  chronology; that is, in the Long Count. Consequently, since any Maya date
  recurred at successive intervals of 52 years, by the time their historic
  period had been reached, more than 3,000 years after the starting point
  of their chronology, the Maya had upward of 70 distinct dates of exactly
  the same name to distinguish from one another.</p>

  <p>It was stated on page <a href="#page61">61</a> that the 0, or starting
  point of Maya chronology, was the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, from which
  all subsequent dates were reckoned; and further, on page <a
  href="#page63">63</a>, that by recording the number of cycles, katuns,
  tuns, uinals, and kins which had elapsed in each case between this date
  and any subsequent dates in the Long Count, subsequent dates of the same
  name could be readily distinguished from one another and assigned at the
  same time to their proper positions in Maya chronology. This method of
  fixing a date in the Long Count has been designated Initial-series
  dating.</p>

  <p>The generally accepted method of writing Initial Series is as
  follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>9.0.0.0.0.<span class="gap"></span><b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The particular Initial-Series written here is to be interpreted thus:
  "Counting forward 9 cycles, 0 katuns, 0 tuns, 0 uinals, and 0 kins <!--
  Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>from
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting point of Maya chronology (always
  unexpressed in Initial Series), the terminal date reached will be <b>8
  Ahau 13 Ceh</b>."<a name="NtA_102" href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> Or
  again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>9.14.13.4.17.<span class="gap"></span><b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This Inital Series reads thus: "Counting forward 9 cycles, 14 katuns,
  13 tuns, 4 uinals, and 17 kins from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting
  point of Maya chronology (unexpressed), the terminal date reached will be
  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>."</p>

  <p>The time which separates any date from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> may be
  called that date's Initial-series value. For example, in the first of the
  above cases the number 9.0.0.0.0 is the Initial-series value of the date
  <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, and in the second the number 9.14.13.4.17 is the
  Initial-series value of the date <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>. It is clear
  from the foregoing that although the date <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, for
  example, had recurred upward of 70 times since the beginning of their
  chronology, the Maya were able to distinguish any particular <b>8 Ahau 13
  Ceh</b> from all the others merely by recording its distance from the
  starting point; in other words, giving thereto its particular
  Initial-series value, as 9.0.0.0.0. in the present case. Similarly, any
  particular <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, by the addition of its corresponding
  Initial-series value, as 9.14.13.4.17 in the case above cited, was
  absolutely fixed in the Long Count&mdash;that is, in a period of 374,400
  years.</p>

  <p>Returning now to the question of how the counting of numbers was
  applied to the Long Count, it is evident that <i>every date in Maya
  chronology, starting points as well as terminal dates, had its own
  particular Initial-series value</i>, though in many cases these values
  are not recorded. However, in most of the cases in which the
  Initial-series values of dates are not recorded, they may be calculated
  by means of their distances from other dates, whose Initial-series values
  are known. This adding and subtracting of numbers to and from Initial
  Series<a name="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> constitutes
  the application of the above-described arithmetical processes to the Long
  Count. Several examples of this use are given below.</p>

  <p>Let us assume for the first case that the number 2.5.6.1 is to be
  counted forward from the Initial Series 9.0.0.0.0 8 <b>Ahau 13 Ceh</b>.
  By multiplying the values of the katuns, tuns, uinals, and kins given in
  Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a> by their corresponding coefficients,
  in this case 2, 5, 6, and 1, respectively, and adding the resulting
  products together, we find that 2.5.6.1 reduces to 16,321 units of the
  first order.</p>

  <p>Counting this forward from <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b> as indicated by the
  rules on pages <a href="#page138">138</a>-<a href="#page143">143</a>, the
  terminal date <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b> will be reached. <!-- Page 149
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>Moreover,
  since the Initial-series value of the starting point <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>
  was 9.0.0.0.0, the Initial-series value of <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b>, the
  terminal date, may be calculated by adding its distance from <b>8 Ahau 13
  Ceh</b> to the Initial-series value of that date:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>9.0.0.0.0 (Initial-series value of starting point) <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b></p>
      <p><span class="hid">9.</span>2.5.6.1 (distance from <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b> to <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b>)</p>
      <p>9.2.5.6.1 (Initial-series value of terminal date) <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That is, by calculation we have determined the Initial-series value of
  the particular <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b>, which was distant 2.5.6.1 from
  9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, to be 9.2.5.6.1, notwithstanding that
  this fact was not recorded.</p>

  <p>The student may prove the accuracy of this calculation by treating
  9.2.5.6.1 <b>1 Imix 9 Yaxkin</b> as a new Initial Series and counting
  forward 9.2.5.6.1 from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting point of all
  Initial Series known except two. If our calculations are correct, the
  former date will be reached just as if we had counted forward only
  2.5.6.1 from 9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>.</p>

  <p>In the above example the distance number 2.5.6.1 and the date <b>1
  Imix 9 Yaxkin</b> to which it reaches, together are called a Secondary
  Series. This method of dating already described (see pp. <a
  href="#page74">74</a>-<a href="#page76">76</a> et seq.) seems to have
  been used to avoid the repetition of the Initial-series values for all
  the dates in an inscription. For example, in the accompanying
  text&mdash;</p>

  <p>the only parts actually recorded are the Initial Series 9.12.2.0.16
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span><b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b>, and the Secondary
  Series 12.9.15 leading to <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b>; the Secondary Series 5
  leading to <b>1 Cib 14 Kankin</b>; and the Secondary Series 1.0.2.5
  leading to <b>5 Imix 19 Zac</b>. The Initial-series values:
  9.12.14.10.11; 9.12.14.10.16; and 9.13.14.13.1, belonging to the three
  dates of the Secondary Series, respectively, do not appear in the text at
  all (a fact indicated by the brackets), but are found only by
  calculation. Moreover, the student should note that in a succession of
  interdependent series like the ones just given the terminal date reached
  by one number, as <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b>, becomes the starting point for
  the next number, 5. Again, the terminal date reached by counting 5 from
  <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b>, that is, <b>1 Cib 14 Kankin</b>, becomes the
  starting point from which the next number, 1.0.2.5, is counted. In other
  words, these terms are only relative, since the terminal date of one
  number will be the starting point of the next.</p>

  <p>Let us assume for the next example, that the number 3.2 is to be
  counted forward from the Initial Series 9.12.3.14.0 <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b>.
  Reducing 3 uinals and 2 kins to kins, we have 62 units of the first
  order. Counting forward 62 from <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b>, as indicated by the
  rules on pages <a href="#page138">138</a>-<a href="#page143">143</a>, it
  is found that the terminal date will be <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b>. Since the
  Initial-series value of the starting point <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b> is known,
  namely, 9.12.3.14.0, the Initial Series corresponding to the terminal
  date may be calculated from it as before:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">3.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">0<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td>(Initial-series value of the starting point) <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 3.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">2<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td>(distance from <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b> forward to <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> [9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">3.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">2]</td> <td>(Initial-series value of the terminal date) <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b></td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The bracketed 9.12.3.17.2 in the Initial-series value corresponding to
  the date <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b> does not appear in the record but was
  reached by calculation. The student may prove the accuracy of this result
  by treating 9.12.3.17.2 <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b> as a new Initial Series, and
  counting forward 9.12.3.17.2 from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> (the starting
  point of Maya chronology, unexpressed in Initial Series). If our
  calculations are correct, the same date, <b>2 Ik 10 Tzec</b>, will be
  reached, as though we had counted only 3.2 forward from the Initial
  Series 9.12.3.14.0 <b>5 Ahau 8 Uo</b>.</p>

  <p>One more example presenting a "backward count" will suffice to
  illustrate this method. Let us count the number 14.13.4.17
  <i>backward</i> from the Initial Series 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5
  Kayab</b>. Reducing 14.13.4.17 to units of the 1st order, we have
  105,577. Counting this number <i>backward</i> from <b>12 Caban 5
  Kayab</b>, as indicated in the rules on pages <a
  href="#page138">138</a>-<a href="#page143">143</a>, we find that the
  terminal date will be <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>. Moreover, since the
  Initial-series value of the starting point <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> is
  known, namely, 9.14.13.4.17, the Initial-series value of <!-- Page 151
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>{151}</span>the terminal
  date may be calculated by <i>subtracting</i> the distance number
  14.13.4.17 from the Initial Series of the starting point:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">13.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 4.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td>(Initial-series value of the starting point) <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">13.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 4.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td>(distance from <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> backward to <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> [9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0]</td> <td>(Initial-series value of the terminal date) <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b></td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The bracketed parts are not expressed. We have seen elsewhere that the
  Initial Series 9.0.0.0.0 has for its terminal date <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>;
  therefore our calculation proves itself.</p>

  <p>The foregoing examples make it sufficiently clear that the distance
  numbers of Secondary Series may be used to determine the Initial-series
  values of Secondary-series dates, either by their addition to or
  subtraction from known Initial-series dates.</p>

  <p>We have come now to the final step in the consideration of Maya
  numbers, namely, the identification of the terminal dates determined by
  the calculations given under the fourth step, pages <a
  href="#page138">138</a>-<a href="#page143">143</a>. This step may be
  summed up as follows:</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Fifth Step in Solving Maya Numbers</span></p>

  <p>Find the terminal date to which the number leads.</p>

  <p>As explained under the fourth step (pp. <a href="#page138">138</a>-<a
  href="#page143">143</a>), the terminal date may be found by calculation.
  The above direction, however, refers to the actual finding of the
  terminal dates in the texts; that is, where to look for them. It may be
  said at the outset in this connection that terminal dates in the great
  majority of cases follow immediately the numbers which lead to them.
  Indeed, the connection between distance numbers and their corresponding
  terminal dates is far closer than between distance numbers and their
  corresponding starting points. This probably results from the fact that
  the closing dates of Maya periods were of far more importance than their
  opening dates. Time was measured by elapsed periods and recorded in terms
  of the ending days of such periods. The great emphasis on the closing
  date of a period in comparison with its opening date probably caused the
  suppression and omission of the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting
  point of Maya chronology, in all Initial Series. To the same cause also
  may probably be attributed the great uniformity in the positions of
  almost all terminal dates, i.e., immediately after the numbers leading to
  them.</p>

  <p>We may formulate, therefore, the following general rule, which the
  student will do well to apply in every case, since exceptions to it are
  very rare:</p>

  <p><i>Rule.</i> The terminal date reached by a number or series almost
  invariably follows immediately the last term of the number or series
  leading to it. <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page152"></a>{152}</span></p>

  <p>This applies equally to all terminal dates, whether in Initial Series,
  Secondary Series, Calendar-round dating or Period-ending dating, though
  in the case of Initial Series a peculiar division or partition of the
  terminal date is to be noted.</p>

  <p>Throughout the inscriptions, excepting in the case of Initial Series,
  the month parts of the dates almost invariably follow immediately the
  days whose positions in the year they designate, without any other glyphs
  standing between; as, for example, <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, <b>12 Caban 5
  Kayab</b>, etc. In Initial Series, on the other hand, the day parts of
  the dates, as <b>8 Ahau</b> and <b>12 Caban</b>, in the above examples,
  are almost invariably separated from their corresponding month parts,
  <b>13 Ceh</b> or <b>5 Kayab</b>, by several intervening glyphs. The
  positions of the day parts in Initial-series terminal dates are quite
  regular according to the terms of the above rule; that is, they follow
  immediately the lowest period of the number which in each case shows
  their distance from the unexpressed starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>. The positions of the corresponding month parts are, on the
  other hand, irregular. These, instead of standing immediately after the
  days whose positions in the year they designate, follow at the close of
  some six or seven intervening glyphs. These intervening glyphs have been
  called the Supplementary Series, though the count which they record has
  not as yet been deciphered.<a name="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> The month glyph in the great majority
  of cases follows immediately the closing<a name="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> glyph of the Supplementary Series.
  The form of this latter sign is always unmistakable (see fig. <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>), and it is further characterized by its numerical
  coefficient, which can never be anything but 9 or 10.<a name="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> See examples of this sign in the
  figure just mentioned, where both normal forms <i>a, c, e, g,</i> and
  <i>h</i> and head variants <i>b, d,</i> and <i>f</i> are included.</p>

  <p>The student will find this glyph exceedingly helpful in locating the
  month parts of Initial-series terminal dates in the inscriptions. For
  example, let us suppose in deciphering the Initial Series 9.16.5.0.0 <b>8
  Ahau 8 Zotz</b> that the number 9.16.5.0.0 has been counted forward <!--
  Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>from
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> (the unexpressed starting point), and has been
  found by calculation to reach the terminal date <b>8 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>; and
  further, let us suppose that on inspecting the text the day part of this
  date (<b>8 Ahau</b>) has been found to be recorded immediately after the
  0 kins of the number 9.16.5.0.0. Now, if the student will follow the next
  six or seven glyphs until he finds one like any of the forms in figure <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>, the glyph immediately following the latter sign
  will be in all probability the month part, <b>8 Zotz</b> in the above
  example, of an Initial-series' terminal date. In other words, although
  the meaning of the glyph shown in the last-mentioned figure is unknown,
  it is important for the student to recognize its form, since it is almost
  invariably the "indicator" of the month sign in Initial Series.</p>

  <p><a name="fig65"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/fig65.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig65.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 65" title="Fig. 65" /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig</span>. 65. Sign for
    the "month indicator": <i>a, c, e, g, h</i>, Normal forms; <i>b, d,
    f</i>, head variants.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In all other cases in the inscriptions, including also the exceptions
  to the above rule, that is, where the month parts of Initial-series
  terminal dates do not immediately follow the closing glyph of the
  Supplementary Series, the month signs follow immediately the day signs
  whose positions in the year they severally designate.</p>

  <p>In the codices the month signs when recorded<a name="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> usually follow immediately the days
  signs to which they belong. The most notable exception<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> to this general rule occurs in
  connection with the Venus-solar periods represented on pages 46-50 of the
  Dresden Codex, where one set of day signs is used with three different
  sets of month signs to form three different sets of dates. For example,
  in one place the day <b>2 Ahau</b> stands above three different month
  signs&mdash;<b>3 Cumhu, 3 Zotz,</b> and <b>13 Yax</b>&mdash;with each of
  which it is used to form a <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span>different date&mdash;<b>2 Ahau 3 Cumhu, 2
  Ahau 3 Zotz,</b> and <b>2 Ahau 13 Yax</b>. In these pages the month
  signs, with a few exceptions, do not follow immediately the days to which
  they belong, but on the contrary they are separated from them by several
  intervening glyphs. This abbreviation in the record of these dates was
  doubtless prompted by the desire or necessity for economizing space. In
  the above example, instead of repeating the <b>2 Ahau</b> with each of
  the two lower month signs, <b>3 Zotz</b> and <b>13 Yax</b>, by writing it
  once above the upper month sign, <b>3 Cumhu</b>, the scribe intended that
  it should be used in turn with each one of the three month signs standing
  below it, to form three different dates, saving by this abbreviation the
  space of two glyphs, that is, double the space occupied by <b>2
  Ahau</b>.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the Initial-series dates in the inscriptions and
  the Venus-Solar dates on pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex, we may say
  that the regular position of the month glyphs in Maya writing was
  immediately following the day glyphs whose positions in the year they
  severally designated.</p>

  <p>In closing the presentation of this last step in the process of
  deciphering numbers in the texts, the great value of the terminal date as
  a final check for all the calculations involved under steps 1-4 (pp. <a
  href="#page134">134</a>-<a href="#page151">151</a>) should be pointed
  out. If after having worked out the terminal date of a given number
  according to these rules the terminal date thus found should differ from
  that actually recorded under step 5, we must accept one of the following
  alternatives:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. There is an error in our own calculations; or</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>2. There is an error in the original text; or</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>3. The case in point lies without the operation of our rules.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is always safe for the beginner to proceed on the assumption that
  the first of the above alternatives is the cause of the error; in other
  words, that his own calculations are at fault. If the terminal date as
  calculated does not agree with the terminal-date as recorded, the student
  should repeat his calculations several times, checking up each operation
  in order to eliminate the possibility of a purely arithmetical error, as
  a mistake in multiplication. After all attempts to reach the recorded
  terminal date by counting the given number from the starting point have
  failed, the process should be reversed and the attempt made to reach the
  starting point by counting backward the given number from its recorded
  terminal date. Sometimes this reverse process will work out correctly,
  showing that there must be some arithmetical error in our original
  calculations which we have failed to detect. However, when both processes
  have failed several times to connect the starting point with the recorded
  terminal date by use of the given number, there remains the possibility
  that either the starting point or the terminal date, or perhaps both, do
  not belong to the given number. The rules for determining this fact <!--
  Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>have
  been given under step 2, page <a href="#page135">135</a>, and step 4,
  page <a href="#page138">138</a>. If after applying these to the case in
  point it seems certain that the starting point and terminal date used in
  the calculations both belong to the given number, we have to fall back on
  the second of the above alternatives, that is, that there is an error in
  the original text.</p>

  <p>Although very unusual, particularly in the inscriptions, errors in the
  original texts are by no means entirely unknown. These seem to be
  restricted chiefly to errors in numerals, as the record of 7 for 8, or 7
  for 12 or 17, that is, the omission or insertion of one or more bars or
  dots. In a very few instances there seem to be errors in the month glyph.
  Such errors usually are obvious, as will be pointed out in connection
  with the texts in which they are found (see Chapters V and VI).</p>

  <p>If both of the above alternatives are found not to apply, that is, if
  both our calculations and the original texts are free from error, we are
  obliged to accept the third alternative as the source of trouble, namely,
  that the case in point lies without the operation of our rules. In such
  cases it is obviously impossible to go further in the present state of
  our knowledge. Special conditions presented by glyphs whose meanings are
  unknown may govern such cases. At all events, the failure of the rules
  under 1-4 to reach the terminal dates recorded as under 5 introduces a
  new phase of glyph study&mdash;the meaning of unknown forms with which
  the beginner has no concern. Consequently, when a text falls without the
  operation of the rules given in this chapter&mdash;a very rare
  contingency&mdash;the beginner should turn his attention elsewhere. <!--

  <p>The present chapter will be devoted to the interpretation of texts

    showing the method of designating particular glyphs in a text.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Before proceeding with this discussion it will first be necessary to
  explain the method followed in designating particular glyphs in a text.
  We have seen (p. <a href="#page23">23</a>) that the Maya glyphs were
  presented in parallel columns, which are to be read two columns at a
  time, the order of the individual glyph-blocks<a name="NtA_111"
  href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> in each pair of columns being from
  left to right and from top to bottom. For convenience in referring to
  particular glyphs in the texts, the vertical columns of glyph-blocks are
  lettered from left to right, thus, A, B, C, D, etc., and the horizontal
  rows numbered from top to bottom, thus, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. For example, in
  figure <a href="#fig66">66</a> the glyph-blocks in columns A and B are
  read together from left to right and top to bottom, thus, A1 B1, A2 B2,
  A3 B3, etc. When glyph-block B10 is reached the next in order is C1,
  which is followed by D1, C2 D2, C3 D3, etc. Again, when D10 is reached
  the next in order is E1, which is followed by F1, E2 F2, E3 F3, etc. In
  this way the order of reading proceeds from left to right and from top to
  bottom, in pairs of columns, that is, G H, I J, K L, and M N throughout
  the inscription, and usually closes with the glyph-block in the lower
  right-hand corner, as N10 in figure <a href="#fig66">66</a>. By this
  simple system of coordinates any particular glyph in a text may be
  readily referred to when the need arises. Thus, for example, in figure <a
  href="#fig66">66</a> glyph <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> is referred
  to as D3; glyph <span class="grk">&beta;</span> as F6; glyph <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span> as K4; glyph <span class="grk">&delta;</span>
  as N10. In a few texts the glyph-blocks are so irregularly placed that it
  is impracticable to designate them by the above coordinates. In such
  cases the order of the glyph-blocks will be indicated by numerals, 1, 2,
  3, etc. In two Copan texts, Altar S (fig. <a href="#fig81">81</a>) and
  Stela J (pl. <a href="#plate15">15</a>), made from the drawings of Mr.
  Maudslay, his numeration of the glyphs has been followed. This numeration
  appears in these two figures.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Initial Series</span></p>

  <p>Because of the fundamental importance of Initial Series in the Maya
  system of chronology, the first class of texts represented will
  illustrate this method of dating. Moreover, since the normal forms for
  the numerals and the period glyphs will be more easily recognised by the
  beginner than the corresponding head variants, the first Initial Series
  given will be found to have all the numerals and period glyphs expressed
  by normal forms.<a name="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate6">6</a> is figured the drawing of the Initial
  Series<a name="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> from Zoömorph
  P at Quirigua, a monument which is said to be the finest piece of
  aboriginal sculpture in the western hemisphere. Our text opens with one
  large glyph, which occupies the space of four glyph-blocks, A1-B2.<a
  name="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> Analysis of this form
  shows that it possesses all the elements mentioned on page <a
  href="#page65">65</a> as belonging to the so-called Initial-series
  introducing glyph, without which Initial Series never seem to have been
  recorded in the inscriptions. These elements are: (1) the trinal <!--
  Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span>superfix, (2) the pair of comblike lateral
  appendages, (3) the normal form of the tun sign, (4) the trinal subfix,
  and (5) the variable central element. As stated above, all these appear
  in the large glyph A1-B2. Moreover, a comparison of A1-B2 with the
  introducing glyphs given in figure <a href="#fig24">24</a> shows that
  these forms are variants of one and the same sign. Consequently, in A1-B2
  we have recorded an Initial-series introducing glyph. The use of this
  sign is so highly specialized that, on the basis of its occurrence alone
  in a text, the student is perfectly justified in assuming that an Initial
  Series will immediately follow.<a name="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> Exceptions to this rule are so very
  rare (see p. <a href="#page67">67</a>) that the beginner will do well to
  disregard them altogether.</p>

  <p>The next glyph after the introducing glyph in an Initial Series is the
  cycle sign, the highest period ever found in this kind of count<a
  name="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>. The cycle sign in the
  present example appears in A3 with the coefficient 9 (1 bar and 4 dots).
  Although the period glyph is partially effaced in the original enough
  remains to trace its resemblance to the normal form of the cycle sign
  shown in figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>a-c</i>. The outline of the
  repeated Cauac sign appears in both places. We have then, in this glyph,
  the record of 9 cycles<a name="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>. The glyph following the cycle sign
  in an Initial Series is always the katun sign, and this should appear in
  B3, the glyph next in order. This glyph is quite clearly the normal form
  of the katun sign, as a comparison of it with figure <a
  href="#fig27">27</a>, <i>a, b</i>, the normal form for the katun, will
  show. It has the normal-form numeral 18 (3 bars and 3 dots) prefixed to
  it, and this whole glyph therefore signifies 18 katuns. The next glyph
  should record the tuns, and a comparison of the glyph in A4 with the
  normal form of the tun sign in figure <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>a,
  b</i>, shows this to be the case. The numeral 5 (1 bar prefixed to the
  tun sign) shows that this period is to be used 5 times; that is,
  multiplied by 5. The next glyph (B4) should be the uinal sign, and a
  comparison of B4 with figure <a href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>a-c</i>, the
  normal form of the uinal sign, shows the identity of these two glyphs.
  The coefficient of the uinal sign contains as its most conspicuous
  element the clasped hand, which suggests that we may have 0 uinals
  recorded in B4. A comparison of this coefficient with the sign for zero
  in figure <a href="#fig54">54</a> proves this to be the case. The next
  glyph (A5) should be the kin sign, the lowest period involved in
  recording Initial Series. A comparison of A5 with the normal form of the
  kin sign in figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>a</i>, shows that these
  two forms are identical. The coefficient of A5 is, moreover, exactly like
  the coefficient of B4, which, we have seen, meant zero, hence glyph A5
  stands for 0 kins. Summarizing the above, we may say that glyphs A3-A5
  record an Initial-series number consisting of 6 cycles, 18 katuns, 5
  tuns, 0 uinals, and 0 kins, which we may write thus: 9.18.5.0.0 (see p.
  <a href="#page138">138</a>, footnote 1). <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

  <p>Now let us turn to Chapter IV and apply the several steps there given,
  by means of which Maya numbers may be solved. The first step on page <a
  href="#page134">134</a> was to reduce the given number, in this case
  9.18.5.0.0, to units of the first order; this may be done by multiplying
  the recorded coefficients by the numerical values of the periods to which
  they are respectively attached. These values are given in Table <a
  href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, and the sum of the products arising from
  their multiplication by the coefficients recorded in the Initial Series
  in plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, A are given below:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> A3 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 9 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 144,000 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 1,296,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0"> B3 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 18 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 7,200 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 129,600</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 1,427,400</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Therefore 1,427,400 will be the number used in the following
  calculations.</p>

  <p>The second step (see step 2, p. <a href="#page135">135</a>) is to
  determine the starting point from which this number is counted. According
  to rule 2, page <a href="#page136">136</a>, if the number is an Initial
  Series the starting point, although never recorded, is practically always
  the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>. Exceptions to this rule are so very rare
  that they may be disregarded by the beginner, and it may be taken for
  granted, therefore, in the present case, that our number 1,427,400 is to
  be counted from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>The third step (see step 3, p. £136) is to determine the direction of
  the count, whether forward or backward. In this connection it was stated
  that the general practice is to count forward, and that the student
  should always proceed upon this assumption. However, in the present case
  there is no room for uncertainty, since the direction of the count in an
  Initial Series is governed by an invariable rule. In Initial Series,
  according to the rule on page <a href="#page137">137</a>, the count is
  always forward, consequently 1,427,400 is to be counted <i>forward</i>
  from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>The fourth step (see step 4, p. <a href="#page138">138</a>) is to
  count the given number from its starting point; and the rules governing
  this process will be found on pages <a href="#page139">139</a>-<a
  href="#page143">143</a>. Since our given number (1,427,400) is greater
  than 18,980, or 1 Calendar Round, the preliminary rule on page <a
  href="#page143">143</a> applies in the present case, and we may therefore
  subtract from 1,427,400 all the Calendar Rounds possible before
  proceeding to count it from the starting point. By referring to Table <a
  href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>, it appears that 1,427,400 contains 75 complete
  Calendar Rounds, or 1,423,500; hence, the latter number may be subtracted
  <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>from 1,427,400 without affecting the value
  of the resulting terminal date: 1,427,400 <span class="nw">-</span>
  1,423,500 = 3,900. In other words, in counting forward 3,900 from <b>4
  Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the same terminal date will be reached as though we had
  counted forward 1,427,400.<a name="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In order to find the coefficient of the day of the terminal date, it
  is necessary, by rule 1, page <a href="#page139">139</a>, to divide the
  given number or its equivalent by 13; 3,900 ÷ 13 = 300. Now since there
  is no fractional part in the resulting quotient, the numerator of an
  assumed fractional part will be 0; counting forward 0 from the
  coefficient of the day of the starting point, 4 (that is, <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>), we reach 4 as the coefficient of the day of the terminal
  date.</p>

  <p>In order to find the day sign of the terminal date, it is necessary,
  under rule 2, page <a href="#page140">140</a>, to divide the given number
  or its equivalent by 20; 3,900 ÷ 20 = 195. Since there is no fractional
  part in the resulting quotient, the numerator of an assumed fractional
  part will be 0; counting forward 0 in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>, from
  <b>Ahau</b>, the day sign of the starting point (<b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>),
  we reach <b>Ahau</b> as the day sign of the terminal date. In other
  words, in counting forward either 3,900 or 1,427,400 from <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>, the day reached will be <b>4 Ahau</b>. It remains to show what
  position in the year this day <b>4 Ahau</b> distant 1,427,400 from the
  date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, occupied.</p>

  <p>In order to find the position in the year which the day of the
  terminal date occupied, it is necessary, under rule 3, page <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, to divide the given number or its equivalent by
  365; 3,900 ÷ 365 = 10<span class="spp">250</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">365</span>. Since the numerator of the fractional part of the
  resulting quotient is 250, to reach the year position of the day of the
  terminal date desired it is necessary to count 250 forward from <b>8
  Cumhu</b>, the year position of the day of the starting point <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>. It appears from Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>, in which the
  365 positions of the year are given, that after position <b>8 Cumhu</b>
  there are only 16 positions in the year&mdash;11 more in <b>Cumhu</b> and
  5 in <b>Uayeb</b>. These must be subtracted, therefore, from 250 in order
  to bring the count to the end of the year; 250 <span class="nw">-</span>
  16 = 234, so 234 is the number of positions we must count forward in the
  new year. It is clear that the first 11 uinals in the year will use up
  exactly 220 of our 234 positions (11 × 20 = 220), and that 14 positions
  will be left, which must be counted in the next uinal, the 12th. But the
  12th uinal of the year is <b>Ceh</b> (see Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a>); counting forward 14 positions in <b>Ceh</b>, we
  reach <b>13 Ceh</b>, which is, therefore, the month glyph of our terminal
  date. In other words, counting 250 forward from <b>8 Cumhu</b>, position
  <b>13 Ceh</b> is reached. Assembling the above values, we find that by
  calculation we have determined the terminal date of the Initial Series in
  plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>A</i>, to be <b>4 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>. <!--
  Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span></p>

  <p>At this point there are several checks which the student may apply to
  his result in order to test the accuracy of his calculations; for
  instance, in the present example if 115, the difference between 365 and
  250 (115 + 250 = 365) is counted forward from position <b>13 Ceh</b>,
  position <b>8 Cumhu</b> will be reached if our calculations were correct.
  This is true because there are only 365 positions in the year, and having
  reached <b>13 Ceh</b> in counting forward 250 from <b>8 Cumhu</b>,
  counting the remaining 115 days forward from day reached by 250, that is,
  <b>13 Ceh</b>, we should reach our starting point (<b>8 Cumhu</b>) again.
  Another good check in the present case would be to count <i>backward</i>
  250 from <b>13 Ceh</b>; if our calculations have been correct, the
  starting point <b>8 Cumhu</b> will be reached. Still another check, which
  may be applied is the following: From Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a>
  it is clear that the day sign <b>Ahau</b> can occupy only positions 3, 8,
  13, or 18 in the divisions of the year;<a name="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> hence, if in the above case the
  coefficient of <b>Ceh</b> had been any other number but one of these
  four, our calculations would have been incorrect.</p>

  <p>We come now to the final step (see step 5, p. <a
  href="#page151">151</a>), the actual finding of the glyphs in our text
  which represent the two parts of the terminal date&mdash;the day and its
  corresponding position in the year. If we have made no arithmetical
  errors in calculations and if the text itself presents no irregular and
  unusual features, the terminal date recorded should agree with the
  terminal date obtained by calculation.</p>

  <p>It was explained on page <a href="#page152">152</a> that the two parts
  of an Initial-series terminal date are usually separated from each other
  by several intervening glyphs, and further that, although the day part
  follows immediately the last period glyph of the number (the kin glyph),
  the month part is not recorded until after the close of the Supplementary
  Series, usually a matter of six or seven glyphs. Returning to our text
  (pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>A</i>), we find that the kins are
  recorded in A5, therefore the day part of the terminal date should appear
  in B5. The glyph in B5 quite clearly records the day <b>4 Ahau</b> by
  means of 4 dots prefixed to the sign shown in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>e'-g'</i>, which is the form for the day name
  <b>Ahau</b>, thereby agreeing with the value of the day part of the
  terminal date as determined by calculation. So far then we have read our
  text correctly. Following along the next six or seven glyphs, A6-C1a,
  which record the Supplementary Series,<a name="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> we reach in C1a a sign similar to the
  forms shown in figure <a href="#fig65">65</a>. This glyph, which always
  has a coefficient of 9 or 10, was designated on page <a
  href="#page152">152</a> the month-sign "indicator," since it usually
  immediately precedes the month sign in Initial-series terminal dates. In
  C1a it has the coefficient 9 (4 dots and 1 bar) and is followed in C1b by
  the month part <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>of the terminal date, <b>13 Ceh</b>. The
  bar and dot numeral 13 appears very clearly above the month sign, which,
  though partially effaced, yet bears sufficient resemblance to the sign
  for <b>Ceh</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>u, v,</i> to enable
  us to identify it as such.</p>

  <p>Our complete Initial Series, therefore, reads: 9.18.5.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13
  Ceh</b>, and since the terminal date recorded in B5, C1b agrees with the
  terminal date determined by calculation, we may conclude that this text
  is without error and, furthermore, that it records a date, <b>4 Ahau 13
  Ceh</b>, which was distant 9.18.5.0.0 from the starting point of Maya
  chronology. The writer interprets this text as signifying that 9.18.5.0.0
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Ceh</b> was the date on which Zoömorph P at Quirigua was
  formally consecrated or dedicated as a time-marker, or in other words,
  that Zoömorph P was the monument set up to mark the hotun, or 5-tun
  period, which came to a close on the date 9.18.5.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>
  of Maya chronology.<a name="NtA_121"

  Initial-series number 9.12.15.13.7. The five period glyphs are all

  no difficulty in identifying them and reading the number, as above
  recorded.</p>

  <p>By means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a> this number may be
  reduced to units of the 1st order, in which form it may be more
  conveniently used. This reduction, which forms the first step in the

  <p>And 1,388,067 will be the number used in the following
  calculations.</p>

  <p>The next step is to find the starting point from which 1,388,067 is
  counted (see step 2, p. <a href="#page135">135</a>). Since this number is
  an Initial Series, in all probability its starting point will be the date
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>; at least it is perfectly safe to proceed on that
  assumption.</p>

  <p>The next step is to find the direction of the count (see step 3, p. <a
  href="#page136">136</a>); since our number is an Initial Series, the
  count can only be forward (see rule 2, p. <a href="#page137">137</a>).<a
  name="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span></p>

  <p>Having determined the number to be counted, the starting point from
  which the count commences, and the direction of the count, we may now
  proceed with the actual process of counting (see step 4, p. <a
  href="#page138">138</a>).</p>

  <p>Since 1,388,067 is greater than 18,980 (1 Calendar Round), we may
  deduct from the former number all the Calendar Rounds possible (see
  preliminary rule, page <a href="#page143">143</a>). According to Table <a
  href="#tableXVI">XVI</a> it appears that 1,388,067 contains 73 Calendar
  Rounds, or 1,385,540; after deducting this from the given number we have
  left 2,527 (1,388,067 <span class="nw">-</span> 1,385,540), a far more
  convenient number to handle than 1,388,067.</p>

  <p>Applying rule 1 (p. <a href="#page139">139</a>) to 2,527, we have:
  2,527 ÷ 13 = 194<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">13</span>, and counting forward 5, the numerator of the
  fractional part of the quotient, from 4, the day coefficient of the
  starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, we reach 9 as the day coefficient
  of the terminal date.</p>

  <p>Applying rule 2 (p. <a href="#page140">140</a>) to 2,527, we have:
  2,527 ÷ 20 = 126<span class="spp">7</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">20</span>; and counting forward 7, the numerator of the
  fractional part of the quotient, from <b>Ahau</b>, the day sign of our
  starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>,
  we reach <b>Manik</b> as the day sign of the terminal date. Therefore,
  the day of the terminal date will be <b>9 Manik</b>.</p>

  <p>Applying rule 3 (p. <a href="#page141">141</a>) to 2,527, we have:
  2,527 ÷ 365 = 6<span class="spp">337</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">365</span>; and counting forward 337, the numerator of the
  fractional part of the quotient, from <b>8 Cumhu</b>, the year position
  of the starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a>, we reach <b>0 Kayab</b> as the year position of
  the terminal date. The calculations by means of which <b>0 Kayab</b> is
  reached are as follows: After <b>8 Cumhu</b> there are 16 positions in
  the year, which we must subtract from 337; 337 <span class="nw">-</span>
  16 = 321, which is to be counted forward in the new year. This number
  contains just 1 more than 16 uinals, that is, 321 = (16 × 20) + 1; hence
  it will reach through the first 16 uinals in Table <a
  href="#tableXV">XV</a> and to the first position in the 17th uinal, <b>0
  Kayab</b>. Combining this with the day obtained above, we have for our
  terminal date determined by calculation, <b>9 Manik 0 Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>The next and last step (see step 5, p. <a href="#page151">151</a>) is
  to find the above date in the text. In Initial Series (see p. <a
  href="#page152">152</a>) the two parts of the terminal date are generally
  separated, the day part usually following immediately the last period
  glyph and the month part the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series.
  In plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>B</i>, the last period glyph, as we
  have seen, is recorded in B3; therefore the day should appear in A4.
  Comparing the glyph in A4 with the sign for <b>Manik</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>j</i>, the two forms are seen to be identical.
  Moreover, A4 has the bar and dot coefficient 9 attached to it, that is, 4
  dots and 1 bar; consequently it is clear that in A4 we have recorded the
  day <b>9 Manik</b>, the same day as reached by calculation. For some
  unknown reason, at Naranjo the month glyphs of the Initial-series
  terminal dates do not regularly follow the closing glyphs of the
  Supplementary Series; <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>indeed, in the text here under discussion,
  so far as we can judge from the badly effaced glyphs, no Supplementary
  Series seems to have been recorded. However, reversing our operation, we
  know by calculation that the month part should be <b>0 Kayab</b>, and by
  referring to figure <a href="#fig49">49</a> we find the only form which
  can be used to express the 0 position with the month signs&mdash;the
  so-called "spectacles" glyph&mdash;which must be recorded somewhere in
  this text to express the idea 0 with the month sign <b>Kayab</b>.
  Further, by referring to figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>, we
  may fix in our minds the sign for the month <b>Kayab</b>, which should
  also appear in the text with one of the forms shown in figure <a
  href="#fig49">49</a>.</p>

  <p>Returning to our text once more and following along the glyphs after
  the day in A4, we pass over B4, A5, and B5 without finding a glyph
  resembling one of the forms in figure <a href="#fig49">49</a> joined to
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>; that is, <b>0 Kayab</b>.
  However, in A6 such a glyph is reached, and the student will have no
  difficulty in identifying the month sign with <i>d'-f'</i> in the above
  figure. Consequently, we have recorded in A4, A6 the same terminal date,
  <b>9 Manik 0 Kayab</b>, as determined by calculation, and may conclude,
  therefore, that our text records without error the date 9.12.15.13.7 <b>9
  Manik 0 Kayab</b><a name="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> of
  Maya chronology.</p>

  <p>The next text presented (pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, C) shows the
  Initial Series from Stela I at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> Again, as in plate <a
  href="#plate6">6</a>, A, the introducing glyph occupies the space of four
  glyph-blocks, namely, A1-B2. Immediately after this, in A3-A4, is
  recorded the Initial-series number 9.18.10.0.0, all the period glyphs and
  coefficients of which are expressed by normal forms. The student's
  attention is called to the form for 0 used with the uinal and kin signs
  in A4a and A4b, respectively, which differs from the form for 0 recorded
  with the uinal and kin signs in plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, A, B4, and
  A5, respectively. In the latter text the 0 uinals and 0 kins were
  expressed by the hand and curl form for zero shown in figure <a
  href="#fig54">54</a>; in the present text, however, the 0 uinals and 0
  kins are expressed by the form for 0 shown in figure <a
  href="#fig47">47</a>, a new feature.</p>

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 75 <!--
  Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span>(see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), it may be reduced to 5,700 without
  affecting its value in the present connection.</p>

  <p>Applying rules 1 and 2 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a> and <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, respectively) to this number, the day reached
  will be found to be <b>10 Ahau</b>; and by applying rule 3 (p. <a
  href="#page141">141</a>), the position of this day in the year will be
  found to be <b>8 Zac</b>. Therefore, by calculation we have determined
  that the terminal date reached by this Initial Series is <b>10 Ahau 8
  Zac</b>. It remains to find this date in the text. The regular position
  for the day in Initial-series terminal dates is immediately following the
  last period glyph, which, as we have seen above, was in A4b. Therefore
  the day glyph should be B4a. An inspection of this latter glyph will show
  that it records the day <b>10 Ahau</b>, both the day sign and the
  coefficient being unusually clear, and practically unmistakable. Compare
  B4a with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>e'-g'</i>, the sign for the
  day name <b>Ahau</b>. Consequently the day recorded agrees with the day
  determined by calculation. The month glyph in this text, as mentioned on
  page <a href="#page157">157</a>, footnote 1, occurs out of its regular
  position, following immediately the day of the terminal date.</p>

  <p>As mentioned on page <a href="#page153">153</a>, when the month glyph
  in Initial-series terminal dates is <i>not</i> to be found in its usual
  position, it will be found in the regular position for the month glyphs
  in all other kinds of dates in the inscriptions, namely, immediately
  following the day glyph to which it belongs. In the present text we found
  that the day, <b>10 Ahau</b>, was recorded in B4a; hence, since the month
  glyph was not recorded in its regular position, it must be in B4b,
  immediately following the day glyph. By comparing the glyph in B4b with
  the month signs in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, it will be found
  exactly like the month sign for <b>Zac</b> (<i>s-t</i>), and we may
  therefore conclude that this is our month glyph and that it is
  <b>Zac</b>. The coefficient of B4b is quite clearly 8 and the month part
  therefore reads, <b>8 Zac</b>. Combining this with the day recorded in
  B4a, we have the date <b>10 Ahau 8 Zac</b>, which corresponds with the
  terminal date determined by calculation. The whole text therefore reads
  9.18.10.0.0 10 <b>Ahau 8 Zac</b>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It will be noted that this date 9.18.10.0.0 10 <b>Ahau 8 Zac</b> is
  just 5.0.0 (5 tuns) later than the date recorded by the Initial Series on
  Zoömorph P at Quirigua (see pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>A</i>). As
  explained in Chapter II (pp. <a href="#page33">33</a>-<a
  href="#page34">34</a>), the interval between succeeding monuments at
  Quirigua is in every case 1,800 days, or 5 tuns. Therefore, it would seem
  probable that at Quirigua at least this period was the unit used for
  marking the lapse of time. As each 5-tun period was completed, its close
  was marked by the erection of a monument, on which was recorded its
  ending date. Thus the writer believes Zoömorph P marked the close of the
  5-tun period ending 9.18.5.0.0 4 <b>Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, and Stela I, the
  5-tun period next following, that ending 9.18.10.0.0 <!-- Page 166
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span><b>10 Ahau 8
  Zac</b>. In other words, Zoömorph P and Stela I were two successive
  time-markers, or "period stones," in the chronological record at
  Quirigua. For this 5-tun period so conspicuously recorded in the
  inscriptions from the older Maya cities the writer would suggest the name
  <i>hotun</i>, <i>ho</i> meaning 5 in Maya and <i>tun</i> being the name
  of the 360-day period. This word has an etymological parallel in the Maya
  word for the 20-tun period, <i>katun</i>, which we have seen may have
  been named directly from its numerical value, <i>kal</i> being the word
  for 20 in Maya and <i>kaltun</i> contracted to katun, thus meaning 20
  tuns. Although no glyph for the <i>hotun</i> has as yet been
  identified,<a name="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> the
  writer is inclined to believe that the sign in figure <a
  href="#fig67">67</a>, <i>a, b</i>, which is frequently encountered in the
  texts, will be found to represent this time period. The bar at the top in
  both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, figure <a href="#fig67">67</a>, surely
  signifies 5; therefore the glyph itself must mean "1 tun." This form
  recalls the very unusual variant of the tun from Palenque (see fig. <a
  href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>h</i>). Both have the wing and the (*<img
  src="images/glyph166.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.43ex;" alt="" title=""

  <p>The next Initial Series presented (see pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>,
  <i>D</i>) is from Stela 24 at Naranjo.<a name="NtA_127"
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> The text opens with the introducing
  glyph, which is in the same relative position as the introducing glyph in
  the other Naranjo text (pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>B</i>) at A1.
  Then follows regularly in B1-B3 the number 9.12.10.5.12, the numbers and
  period glyphs of which are all expressed by normal forms. By this time
  the student should have no difficulty in recognizing these and in
  determining the number as given above. Reducing this according to rule 1,

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>{167}</span></p>

  <p>Turning again to the text (pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>D</i>), the
  next step (see step 5, p. <a href="#page151">151</a>) is to find the
  glyphs representing the above terminal date. In this connection it should
  be remembered that the day part of an Initial-series terminal date
  usually follows immediately the last period glyph of the number. The
  glyph in A4, therefore, should record the day reached. Comparing this
  form with the several day signs in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, it
  appears that A4 more closely resembles the sign for <b>Eb</b> (fig. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>s-u</i>) than any of the others, hence the
  student may accept <b>Eb</b> as the day sign recorded in A4. The 4 dots
  prefixed to this sign show that the day <b>4 Eb</b> is here indicated.
  The month sign, as stated on page <a href="#page152">152</a>, usually
  follows the last glyph of the Supplementary Series; passing over B4, A5,
  B5, and A6, we reach the latter glyph in B6. Compare the left half of B6
  with the forms given in figure <a href="#fig65">65</a>. The coefficient 9
  or 10 is expressed by a considerably effaced head numeral. Immediately
  following the month-sign "indicator" is the month sign itself in A7. The
  student will have little difficulty in tracing its resemblance to the
  month <b>Yax</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q, r</i>, although
  in A7 the <b>Yax</b> element itself appears as the prefix instead of as
  the superfix, as in <i>q</i> and <i>r</i>, just cited. This difference,
  however, is immaterial. The month coefficient is quite clearly 10,<a
  name="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> and the whole terminal
  date recorded will read <b>4 Eb 10 Yax</b>, which corresponds exactly
  with the terminal date determined by calculation. We may accept this
  text, therefore, as recording the Initial-series date 9.12.10.5.12 <b>4
  Eb 10 Yax</b> of Maya chronology.</p>

  <p>In the foregoing examples nothing but normal-form period glyphs have
  been presented, in order that the first exercises in deciphering the
  inscriptions may be as easy as possible. By this time, however, the
  student should be sufficiently familiar with the normal forms of the
  period glyphs to be able to recognize them when they are present in the
  text, and the next Initial Series figured will have its period glyphs
  expressed by head variants.</p>

  <p>In A, plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>, is figured the Initial Series
  from Stela B at Copan.<a name="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears at the
  head of the inscription in A1 <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>and is followed by a head-variant glyph in
  A2, to which is prefixed a bar and dot coefficient of 9. By its position,
  immediately following the introducing glyph, we are justified in assuming
  that A2 records 9 cycles, and after comparing it with <i>d-f</i>, figure
  <a href="#fig25">25</a>, where the head variant of the cycle sign is
  shown, this assumption becomes a certainty. Both heads have the same
  clasped hand in the same position, across the lower part of the face,
  which, as explained on page <a href="#page68">68</a>, is the essential
  element of the cycle head; therefore, A2 records 9 cycles. The next
  glyph, A3, should be the katun sign, and a comparison of this form with
  the head variant for katun in <i>e-h</i>, figure <a href="#fig27">27</a>,
  shows this to be the case. The determining characteristic (see p. <a
  href="#page69">69</a>) is probably the oval in the top of the head, which
  appears in both of these forms for the katun. The katun coefficient is 15
  (3 bars). The next glyph, A4, should record the tuns, and by comparing
  this form with the head variant for the tun sign in <i>e-g</i>, figure <a
  href="#fig29">29</a>, this also is found to be the case. Both heads show
  the same essential characteristic&mdash;the fleshless lower jaw (see p.
  <a href="#page70">70</a>). The coefficient is 0 (compare fig. <a
  href="#fig47">47</a>). The uinal head in A5 is equally unmistakable. Note
  the large curl protruding from the back part of the mouth, which was said
  (p. <a href="#page71">71</a>) to be the essential element of this sign.
  Compare figure <a href="#fig31">31</a>, <i>d-f</i>, where the head
  variant for the uinal is given. The coefficient of A5 is like the
  coefficient of A4 (0), and we have recorded, therefore, 0 uinals. The
  closing period glyph of the Initial Series in A6 is the head variant for
  the kin sign. Compare this form with figure <a href="#fig34">34</a>,
  <i>e-g</i>, where the kin head is figured. The determining characteristic
  of this head is the subfixial element, which appears also in the normal
  form for the kin sign (see fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>a</i>).
  Again, the coefficient of A6 is like the coefficient of A4 and A5, hence
  we have recorded here 0 kins.</p>

  <p>The number recorded by the head-variant period glyphs and normal-form
  numerals in A2-A6 is therefore 9.15.0.0.0; reducing this by means of

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), it may be reduced to 18,460. Applying
  to this number rules 1 and 2 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a> and <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, respectively), the day reached will be found to
  be <b>4 Ahau</b>. Applying rule 3 (p. <a href="#page141">141</a>), the
  position of <b>4 Ahau</b> in the year will be found to be <b>13 Yax</b>.
  Therefore the terminal date determined by calculation will be <b>4 Ahau
  13 Yax</b>. <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span></p>

  <p>According to step 5 (p. <a href="#page151">151</a>), the day reached
  should follow immediately the last period glyph, which in this case was
  in A6; hence the day should be recorded in A7. This glyph has a
  coefficient 4, but the glyph does not resemble either of the forms for
  <b>Ahau</b> shown in B5, plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>A</i>, or in
  B4a, <i>C</i> of the same plate. However, by comparing this glyph with
  the second variant for the day sign <b>Ahau</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h'-i'</i>, the two forms will be found to be
  identical, and we may accept A7 as recording the day <b>4 Ahau</b>.
  Immediately following in A8 is the month sign, again out of its usual
  place as in plate 6, <i>C</i>. Comparing it with the month signs in
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, it will be found to exactly correspond
  with the sign for <b>Yax</b> in <i>q-r</i>. The coefficient is 13.
  Therefore the terminal date recorded, <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, agrees with
  the terminal date reached by calculation, and the whole Initial Series
  reads 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>. This date marks the close not only
  of a hotun in the Long Count, but of a katun as well.</p>

  <p>Deducting from this all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see Table <a
  href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1 and 2 (pp. <a
  href="#page139">139</a> and <a href="#page140">140</a>, respectively), to
  the remainder, the day reached will be <b>12 Ahau</b>. And applying rule
  3 (p. <a href="#page141">141</a>), the month reached will be <b>18

  Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>. The day should be recorded in B4, and an examination
  of this glyph shows that its coefficient is 12, the day coefficient
  reached by calculation. The glyph itself, however, is unlike the forms
  for <b>Ahau</b> previously encountered in plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>,
  <i>A</i>, B5 and <i>C</i>, B4b, and in plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>,
  <i>A</i>, A7. Turning <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page170"></a>{170}</span>now to the forms for the day sign
  <b>Ahau</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, it is seen that the form
  in A4 resembles the third variant <i>j</i>' or <i>k'</i>, the grotesque
  head, and it is clear that the day <b>12 Ahau</b> is here recorded. At
  first sight the student might think that the month glyph follows in A5,
  but a closer inspection of this form shows that this is not the case. In
  the first place, since the day sign is <b>Ahau</b> the month coefficient
  must be either 3, 8, 13, or 18, not 7, as recorded (see Table <a
  href="#tableVII">VII</a>), and, in the second place, the glyph itself in
  A5 bears no resemblance whatsoever to any of the month signs in figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>. Consequently the month part of the Initial-series
  terminal date of this text should follow the closing glyph of the
  Supplementary Series. Following along the glyphs next in order, we reach
  in A9 a glyph with a coefficient 9, although the sign itself bears no
  resemblance to the month-glyph "indicators" heretofore encountered (see
  fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>).</p>

  <p>The glyph following, however, in A9b is quite clearly <b>18 Cumhu</b>
  (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g'-h'</i>), which is the month part
  of the terminal date as reached by calculation. Therefore, since A9a has
  the coefficient 9 it is probable that it is a variant of the month-glyph
  "indicator";<a name="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> and
  consequently that the month glyph itself follows, as we have seen, in B9.
  In other words, the terminal date recorded, <b>12 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>,
  agrees with the terminal date reached by calculation, and the whole text,
  so far as it can be deciphered, reads 9.14.19.8.0 <b>12 Ahau 18
  Cumhu</b>. The student will note that this Initial Series precedes the
  Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>, <i>A</i> by exactly 10
  uinals, or 200 days. Compare <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, plate <a
  href="#plate7">7</a>.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate8">8</a>, <i>A</i>, is figured the Initial
  Series from Stela 6 at Copan.<a name="NtA_135"
  href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> The introducing glyph occupies the
  space of four glyph-blocks, A1-B2, and there follows in A3-B4a the
  Initial-series number 9.12.10.0.0. The cycle glyph in A3 is partially
  effaced; the clasped hand, however, the determining characteristic of the
  cycle head, may still be distinguished. The katun head in B3 is also
  unmistakable, as it has the same superfix as in the normal form for the
  katun. At first sight the student might read the bar and dot coefficient
  as 14, but the two middle crescents are purely decorative and have no
  numerical value, and the numeral recorded here is 12 (see pp. 88-91).
  Although the tun and uinal period glyphs in A4a and A4b,<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> respectively, are effaced, their
  coefficients may be distinguished as 10 and 0, respectively. In such a
  case the student is perfectly justified in assuming that the tun and
  uinal signs originally stood here. In B4a the kin period glyph is
  expressed by its normal form and the kin coefficient by a head-variant
  numeral, the clasped hand of which indicates that it stands for 0 (see
  fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>s-w</i>).<a name="NtA_137"

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying to the remainder rules
  1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>-<a href="#page141">141</a>),
  respectively, the date reached by the resulting calculations will be <b>9
  Ahau 18 Zotz</b>. Turning to our text again, the student will have little
  difficulty in identifying B4b as <b>9 Ahau</b>, the day of the above
  terminal date. The form <b>Ahau</b> here recorded is the grotesque head,
  the third variant <i>j'</i> or <i>k'</i> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>. Following the next glyphs in order, A5-A6, the
  closing glyph of the Supplementary Series is reached in B6a. Compare this
  glyph with the forms in figure <a href="#fig65">65</a>. The coefficient
  of B6a is again a head-variant numeral, as in the case of the kin period
  glyph in B4a, above. The fleshless lower jaw and other skull-like
  characteristics indicate that the numeral 10 is here recorded. Compare
  B6a with figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>. Since B6a is the
  last glyph of the Supplementary Series, the next glyph B6b should
  represent the month sign. By comparing the latter form with the month
  signs in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a> the student will readily
  recognize that the sign for <b>Zotz</b> in <i>e</i> or <i>f</i> is the
  month sign here recorded. The coefficient 18 stands above. Consequently,
  B4b and B6b represent the same terminal date, <b>9 Ahau 18 Zotz</b>, as
  reached by calculation. This whole Initial Series reads 9.12.10.0.0 <b>9
  Ahau 18 Zotz</b>, and according to the writer's view, the monument upon
  which it occurs (Stela 6 at Copan) was the period stone for the hotun
  which began with the day 9.12.5.0.1 <b>4 Imix 4 Xul</b><a name="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> and ended with the day 9.12.10.0.0
  <b>9 Ahau 18 Zotz</b>, here recorded.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate8">8</a>, <i>B</i>, is figured the Initial
  Series from Stela 9 at Copan.<a name="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> The introducing glyph stands in A1-B2
  and is followed by the five period glyphs in A3-A5. The cycle is very
  clearly recorded in A3, the clasped hand being of a particularly
  realistic form. Although <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>the coefficient is partially effaced,
  enough remains to show that it was above 5, having had originally more
  than the one bar which remains, and less than 11, there being space for
  only one more bar or row of dots. In all the previous Initial Series the
  cycle coefficient was 9, consequently it is reasonable to assume that 4
  dots originally occupied the effaced part of this glyph. If the use of 9
  cycles in this number gives a terminal date which agrees with the
  terminal date recorded, the above assumption becomes a certainty. In B3
  six katuns are recorded. Note the ornamental dotted ovals on each side of
  the dot in the numeral 6. Although the head for the tun in A4 is
  partially effaced, we are warranted in assuming that this was the period
  originally recorded here. The coefficient 10 appears clearly. The uinal
  head in B4 is totally unfamiliar and seems to have the fleshless lower
  jaw properly belonging to the tun head; from its position, however, the
  4th in the number, we are justified in calling this glyph the uinal sign.
  Its coefficient denotes that 0 uinals are recorded here. Although the
  period glyph in A5 is also entirely effaced, the coefficient appears
  clearly as 0, and from position again, 5th in the number, we are
  justified once more in assuming that 0 kins were originally recorded,
  here. It seems at first glance that the above reading of the number A3-A5
  rests on several assumptions:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. That the cycle coefficient was originally 9.</p>
      <p>2. That the effaced glyph in A4 was a tun head.</p>
      <p>3. That the irregular head in B4 is a uinal head.</p>
      <p>4. That the effaced glyph in A5 was a kin sign.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The last three are really certainties, since the Maya practice in
  recording Initial Series demanded that the five period glyphs
  requisite&mdash;the cycle, katun, tun, uinal, and kin&mdash;should follow
  each other in this order, and in no other. Hence, although the 3d, 4th,
  and 5th glyphs are either irregular or effaced, they must have been the
  tun, uinal, and kin signs, respectively. Indeed, the only important
  assumption consisted in arbitrarily designating the cycle coefficient 9,
  when, so far as the appearance of A3 is concerned, it might have been
  either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. The reason for choosing 9 rests on the
  overwhelming evidence of antecedent probability. Moreover, as stated
  above, if the terminal date recorded agrees with the terminal date
  determined by calculation, using the cycle coefficient as 9, our
  assumption becomes a certainty. Designating the above number as
  9.6.10.0.0 then and reducing this by means of Table <a

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 70 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, the date
  determined by the resulting calculations will be <b>8 Ahau 13 Pax</b>.
  Turning to our text again, the student will have little difficulty in
  recognizing the first part of this date, the day <b>8 Ahau</b>, in B5.
  The numeral 8 appears clearly, and the day sign is the profile-head
  <i>h'</i> or <i>i'</i>, the second variant for <b>Ahau</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>. The significance of the element standing between
  the numeral and the day sign is unknown. Following along through A6, B6,
  A7, B7, the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series is reached in A8.
  The glyph itself is on the left and the coefficient, here expressed by a
  head variant, is on the right. The student will have no difficulty in
  recognizing the glyph and its coefficient by comparing the former with
  figure <a href="#fig65">65</a>, and the latter with the head variant for
  10 in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>. Note the fleshless
  lower jaw in the head numeral in both places. The following glyph, B8, is
  one of the clearest in the entire text. The numeral is 13, and the month
  sign on comparison with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a> unmistakably
  proves itself to be the sign for <b>Pax</b> in <i>c'</i>. Therefore the
  terminal date recorded in B5, B8, namely, <b>8 Ahau 13 Pax</b>, agrees
  with the terminal date determined by calculation; it follows, further,
  that the effaced cycle coefficient in A3 must have been 9, the value
  tentatively ascribed to it in the above calculations. The whole Initial
  Series reads 9.6.10.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Pax</b>.</p>

  <p>Some of the peculiarities of the numerals and signs in this text are
  doubtless due to its very great antiquity, for the monument presenting
  this inscription, Stela 9, records the next to earliest Initial Series<a
  name="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> yet deciphered at
  Copan.<a name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> Evidences of
  antiquity appear in the glyphs in several different ways. The bars
  denoting 5 have square ends and all show considerable ornamentation. This
  type of bar was an early manifestation and gave way in later times to
  more rounded forms. The dots also show this greater ornamentation, which
  is reflected, too, by the signs themselves. The head forms show greater
  attention to detail, giving the whole glyph a more ornate appearance. All
  this embellishment gave way in later times to more simplified forms, and
  we have represented in this text a stage in glyph morphology before
  conventionalization had worn down the different signs to little more than
  their essential elements. <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  terminal date <b>6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin</b>. Looking for the day part of this

  <b>6 Ahau</b>, the day determined by calculation. Moreover, comparison of
  it with the day signs in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a> shows that it is
  unlike all of them; further, there is <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>no bar and dot
  coefficient. These several points indicate that the day sign is not the
  glyph in B5, also that the day sign is, therefore, out of its regular
  position. The next glyph in the text, A6, instead of being one of the
  Supplementary Series is the day glyph <b>6 Ahau</b>, which should have
  been recorded in B5. The student will readily make the same
  identification after comparing A6 with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>e'-g'</i>. A glance at the remainder of the text, will show that no
  Supplementary Series is recorded, and consequently that the month glyph
  will be found immediately following the day glyph in B6. The form in B6
  has a coefficient 13, one of the four (3, 8, 13, 18) which the month must
  have, since the day sign is <b>Ahau</b> (see Table <a

  signs in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a> shows that the month
  <b>Yaxkin</b> in <i>k</i> or <i>l</i> is the form here recorded;
  therefore the terminal date recorded agrees with the terminal date

  easily read as 9.12.8.14.? An inspection of our text shows that the
  coefficient must be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Let us work out the terminal dates for
  all four of these values, commencing with 0, and then see which of the

  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), to the remainder, the terminal
  day reached will be <b>11 Ahau 3 Pop</b>. Therefore the Initial-series
  numbers 9.12.8.14.1, 9.12.8.14.2, and 9.12.8.14.3 will lead to the three
  days immediately following 9.12.8.14.0 <b>11 Ahau 3 Pop</b>. Therefore
  our four possible terminal dates will be:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> 9.12.8.14.0</td><td> <b>11 Ahau</b></td><td> <b>3 Pop</b></td></tr>
<tr><td> 9.12.8.14.1</td><td> <b>12 Imix</b></td><td> <b>4 Pop</b> &#x2190;</td></tr>

<tr><td> 9.12.8.14.3</td><td> <b><span class="hid">0</span>1 Akbal</b></td><td> <b>6 Pop</b></td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Now let us look for one of these four terminal dates in the text. The
  day reached by an Initial Series is almost invariably recorded
  immediately after the last period glyph; therefore, if this inscription
  is regular, the day glyph should be B4. This glyph probably has the
  coefficient 12 (2 bars and 2 numerical dots), the oblong element between
  probably being ornamental only. This number must be either 11 or 12,
  since if it were 13 the 3 dots would all be of the same size, which is
  not the case. An inspection of the coefficient in B4 eliminates from
  consideration, therefore, the last two of the above four possible
  terminal dates, and reduces the possible values for the kin coefficient
  in A4 to 0 or 1. Comparing the glyph in B4 with the day signs in figure
  <a href="#fig16">16</a>, the form here recorded will be found to be
  identical with the sign for <b>Imix</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a</i>. This eliminates the first terminal date
  above and leaves the second, the day part of which <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>we have just seen
  appears in B4. This further proves that the kin coefficient in A4 is 1.
  The final confirmation of this identification will come from the month
  glyph, which must be <b>4 Pop</b> if we have correctly identified the day
  as <b>12 Imix</b>. If, on the other hand, the day were <b>11 Ahau</b>,
  the month glyph would be <b>3 Pop</b>. Passing over A5 B5, A6 B6, C1 D1,
  and C2, we, reach in D2a the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series,
  here showing the coefficient 9. Compare this form with figure <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>. The month glyph, therefore, should appear in D2b.
  The coefficient of this glyph is very clearly 4, thus confirming our
  identification of B4 as <b>12 Imix</b>. (See Table <a
  href="#tableVII">VII</a>.) And finally, the month glyph itself is
  <b>Pop</b>. Compare D2b with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>a</i>.
  The whole Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate9">9</a>, <i>B</i>,
  therefore reads 9.12.8.14.1 <b>12 Imix 4 Pop</b>.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate10">10</a>, is figured the Initial Series from
  Stela 3 at Tikal.<a name="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>
  The introducing glyph, though somewhat effaced, may still be recognized
  in A1. The Initial-series number follows in B1-B3. The head-variant
  period glyphs are too badly weathered to show the determining
  characteristic in each case, except the uinal head in A3, the mouth curl
  of which appears clearly, and their identification rests on their
  relative positions with reference to the introducing glyph. The
  reliability of this basis of identification for the period glyphs of
  Initial Series has been thoroughly tested in the texts already presented
  and is further confirmed in this very inscription by the uinal head. Even
  if the large mouth curl of the head in A3 had not proved that the uinal
  was recorded here, we should have assumed this to be the case because
  this glyph, A3, is the fourth from the introducing glyph. The presence of
  the mouth curl therefore confirms the identification based on position.
  The student will have no difficulty in reading the number recorded in
  B1-B3 as 9.2.13.0.0.</p>

  <p>Reducing this number by means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>

  in the text. The glyph in A4, the proper position for the day glyph, is
  somewhat effaced, though the profile of the human head may yet be traced,
  thus enabling us to identify this form as the day sign <b>Ahau</b>.
  Compare figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h', i'</i>. The coefficient of
  A4 is very clearly 4 dots, that is, 4, and consequently this glyph agrees
  with the day as determined by calculation, <b>4 Ahau</b>. Passing over
  B4, A5, B5, and A6, we reach in B6 the closing glyph of the Supplementary
  Series, here recorded with a coefficient of 9. Compare B6 with figure <a
  href="#fig65">65</a>. The month glyph follows in A7 with the coefficient
  13. Comparing this latter glyph with the month signs in figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, it is evident that the month <b>Kayab</b> (fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>) is recorded in A7, which reads,
  therefore, <b>13 Kayab</b>. Hence the whole text records the Initial

  recorded (fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h', i'</i>), and to it is
  attached a head-variant numeral. Comparing this with the head-variant
  numerals in figures <a href="#fig51">51</a>-<a href="#fig53">53</a>, the
  student will have little difficulty in identifying it as the head for 6
  (see fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>t-v</i>). Note the so-called
  "hatchet eye" in A5, which is the determining characteristic of the head
  for 6 (see p. <a href="#page99">99</a>). Passing over A6 B6, A7 B7, A8
  B8, we reach in A9 the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, here
  showing the head-variant coefficient 10 (see fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>). In B9, the next glyph, is recorded the
  month <b>13 Kayab</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>).
  The whole Initial Series therefore reads 9.17.5.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13
  Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>All the Initial Series heretofore presented have had normal-form
  numerals with the exception of an incidental head-variant number here and
  there. By this time the student should have become thoroughly familiar
  with the use of bar and dot numerals in the inscriptions and should be
  ready for the presentation of texts showing head-variant numerals, a more
  difficult group of glyphs to identify.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate12">12</a>, <i>A</i>, is figured the Initial
  Series on the tablet from the Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.<a
  name="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> The introducing glyph
  appears in A1 B2, and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-B7.
  The student will have little difficulty in identifying the heads in B3,
  B4, B5, B6, and B7 as the head variants for the cycle, katun, tun, uinal,
  and kin, respectively. The head in A3 prefixed to the cycle glyph in B3
  has for its determining characteristic the forehead ornament composed of
  <i>more than one part</i> (here, of two parts). As explained on page <a
  href="#page97">97</a>, this is the essential element of the head for 1.
  Compare A3 with figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>a-e</i>, and the two
  glyphs will be found to be identical. We may conclude, therefore, that in
  place of the usual 9 cycles heretofore encountered in Initial Series, we
  have recorded in A3-B3 1 cycle.<a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> The katun coefficient in A4 resembles
  closely the cycle coefficient except that its forehead ornament is
  composed of but a single part, a large curl. As explained on page <a
  href="#page97">97</a>, the heads for 1 and 8 are very similar, and are to
  be distinguished from each other only by their forehead ornaments, the
  former having a forehead ornament composed of more than one part, as in
  A3, and the latter a forehead ornament composed of but one part, as here
  in A4. This head, moreover, is very similar to the head for 8 in figure
  <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>; indeed, the only difference is that
  the former has a fleshless lower jaw. This is the essential element of
  the head for 10 (see p. <a href="#page100">100</a>); when applied to the
  head for any other numeral it increases the value of the resulting head
  by 10. Therefore we have recorded in A4 B4, 18 (8 + 10) katuns. The tun
  coefficient in A5 has for its determining characteristic the tun
  headdress, which, as explained on page <a href="#page99">99</a>, is the
  essential element of the head for 5 (see fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>,
  <i>n-s</i>). Therefore A5 represents 5, and A5 B5, 5 tuns. The uinal
  coefficient in A6 has for its essential elements the large bulging eye,
  square irid, and snaglike front tooth. As stated on page <a
  href="#page98">98</a>, these characterize the head for 4, examples of
  which are given in figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>j-m</i>.
  Consequently, A6 B6 records 4 uinals. The kin coefficient in A7 is quite
  clearly 0. The student will readily recognize the clasped hand, which is
  the determining characteristic of the 0 head (see p. <a
  href="#page101">101</a> and fig. <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>s-w</i>).
  The number recorded in A3-B7 is, therefore, 1.18.5.4.0. Reducing this
  number to units of the 1st order by means of Table <a

  immediately the day glyph, i.e., in A9. The glyph in A9 has a coefficient
  13, which agrees with the month coefficient determined by calculation,
  and a comparison of B9 with the forms for the months in figure <a

  The student will have no difficulty in identifying the period glyphs in

  record the numbers 1, 18, and 5, respectively. The uinal coefficient in

  the banded headdress, or fillet, which distinguishes the head for 3, as
  explained on page <a href="#page98">98</a> (see fig. <a

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 14 (see

  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>), respectively, to the remainder, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>13 Cimi 19 Ceh</b>. If this inscription is
  regular, the day part of the above date should follow in A8 B8, the
  former expressing the coefficient and the latter the day sign. Comparing
  A8 with the head numerals in figures <a href="#fig51">51</a>-<a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, it will be found to be like the second variant for
  13 in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>x-b'</i>, the essential element
  of which seems to be the pendulous nose surmounted by a curl, the
  protruding mouth fang, and the large bulging eye. Comparing the glyph in
  B8 with the day signs in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, it will be seen
  that the form here recorded is the day sign <b>Cimi</b> (fig. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h, i</i>). Therefore A8 B8 expresses the day
  <b>13 Cimi</b>. The month glyph is recorded very irregularly in this
  text, since it occurs neither immediately after the Supplementary Series
  or the day sign, but the second glyph after the day sign, in B9. A
  comparison of this form with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>u-v</i>,
  shows that the month <b>Ceh</b> is recorded here. The coefficient is 19.
  Why the glyph in A9 should stand between the day and its month glyph is
  unknown; this case constitutes one of the many unsolved problems in the
  study of the Maya glyphs. This whole Initial Series reads 1.18.5.3.6
  <b>13 Cimi 19 Ceh</b>.</p>

  <p>The student will note that this Initial Series records a date 14 days
  earlier than the preceding Initial Series (pl. <a href="#plate12">12</a>,
  <i>A</i>). That two dates should be recorded which were within 14 days of
  each other, and yet were more than 3,000 years earlier than practically
  all other Maya dates, is a puzzling problem. These two Initial Series
  from the Temple of the Sun and that of the Foliated Cross at Palenque,
  together with a Secondary-series date from the Temple of the Cross in the
  same city, have been thoroughly reviewed by Mr. Bowditch (1906). The
  conclusions he reaches and the explanation he offers to account for the
  occurrence of three dates so remote as these are very reasonable, and,
  the writer believes, will be generally accepted by Maya students. <!--

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig69">69</a>, <i>A</i>, is shown the Initial
  Series inscribed on the rises and treads of the stairway leading to House
  C in the Palace at Palenque.<a name="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> The introducing glyph is recorded in
  A1, and the Initial-series number follows in B1-B3. The student will
  readily recognize the period glyphs in B1b, A2b, B2b, A3b, and B3b. The
  head expressing the cycle coefficient in B1a has for its essential
  element the dots centering around the corner of the mouth. As explained
  on page <a href="#page100">100</a>, this characterizes the head for 9
  (see fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>g-l</i>, where variants for the 9
  head are figured). In B1, therefore, we have recorded 9 cycles, the
  number almost always found in Initial Series as the cycle coefficient.
  The essential element of the katun coefficient in A2a is the forehead
  ornament composed of a single part. This denotes the head for 8 (see p.
  <a href="#page100">100</a>, and fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>;
  also compare A2a with the heads denoting 18 in the two preceding
  examples, pl. <a href="#plate12">12</a>, <i>A</i>, A4, and pl. <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, <i>B</i>, A4, each of which shows the same
  forehead ornament). The tun coefficient in B2a is exactly like the cycle
  coefficient just above it in B1a; that is, 9, having the same dotting of
  the face near the corner of the mouth. The uinal coefficient in A3a is
  13. Compare this head numeral with A8, plate <a href="#plate12">12</a>,
  <i>B</i>, which also denotes 13, and also with figure <a

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 71 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, we reach as the
  terminal date <b>8 Ahau 13 Pop</b>. Now let us examine the text and see
  what is the terminal date actually recorded. In A4b the student will have
  little difficulty in recognizing the profile variant of the day sign
  <b>Ahau</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h', i'</i>). This at
  once gives us the missing value for the kin coefficient in B3, for the
  day <b>Ahau</b> can never be reached in an Initial Series if the kin
  coefficient is other than 0. Similarly, the day <b>Imix</b> can never be
  reached in Initial Series if the kin coefficient is other than 1, etc.
  Every one of the 20 possible kin coefficients, 0 to 19, has a
  corresponding day to which it will always lead, that is, <b>Ahau</b> to
  <b>Cauac</b>, respectively (see Table <a href="#tableI">I</a>). Thus, if
  the kin coefficient in an Initial-series number were 5, for example, the
  day sign of the resulting terminal date must be <b>Chicchan</b>, since
  <b>Chicchan</b> is the fifth name after <b>Ahau</b> in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a>. Thus the day sign in Initial-series terminal dates
  may be determined by inspection of the kin coefficient as well as by rule
  2 (p. <a href="#page140">140</a>), though, as the student will see, both
  are applications of the same principle, that is, deducting all of the 20s
  possible and counting forward only the remainder. Returning to our text,
  we can now say without hesitation that our number is 9.8.9.13.0 and that
  the day sign in A4b is <b>Ahau</b>. The day coefficient in A4a is just
  like the katun coefficient in A2a, having the same determining
  characteristic, namely, the forehead ornament composed of one part. A
  comparison of this ornament with the ornament on the head for 8 in A2a
  will show that the two forms are identical. The bifurcate ornament
  surmounting the head in A4a is a part of the headdress, and as such
  should not be confused with the forehead ornament. The failure to
  recognize this point might cause the student to identify <!-- Page 185
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>A4a as the
  head for 1, that is, having a forehead ornament composed of more than one
  part, instead of the head for 8. The month glyph, which follows in B4b,
  is unfortunately effaced, though its coefficient in B4a is clearly the
  head for 13. Compare B4a with the uinal coefficient in A3a and with the
  heads for 13 in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>x-b'</i>. As recorded,
  therefore, the terminal date reads <b>8 Ahau 13</b> ?, thus agreeing in
  every particular so far as it goes with the terminal date reached by
  calculation, <b>8 Ahau 13 Pop</b>. In all probability the effaced sign in
  B4b originally was the month <b>Pop</b>. The whole Initial Series
  therefore reads 9.8.9.13.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Pop</b>.</p>

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig69">69</a>, <i>B</i>, is shown the Initial

  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2 and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-B4. The student
  will readily identify A3, B3, and A4 as 9 cycles, 9 katuns, and 10 tuns,
  respectively. Note the beard on the head representing the number 9 in
  both A3a and B3a. As explained on page <a href="#page100">100</a>, this
  characteristic of the head for 9 is not always present (see fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>g-i</i>). The uinal and kin glyphs have been
  crowded together into one glyph-block, B4, the uinal appearing in B4a and
  the kin in B4b. Both their coefficients are 0, which is expressed in each

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig70">70</a> is illustrated the Initial Series
  from Zoömorph G at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2 and is followed in C1-H1 by the Initial-series number. Glyphs C1 D1
  record 9 cycles. The dots on the head for 9 in C1 are partially effaced.
  In C2 is the katun coefficient and in D2 the katun sign. The determining
  characteristic of the head for 7 appears in C2, namely, the scroll
  passing under the eye and projecting upward and in front of the forehead.
  See page <a href="#page100">100</a> and figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>,
  <i>w</i>. It would seem, then, at first sight that 7 katuns were recorded
  in C2 D2. That this was not the case, however, a closer examination of C2
  will show. Although the lower part of this glyph is somewhat weathered,
  enough still remains to show that this head originally had a fleshless
  lower jaw, a character increasing its value by 10. Consequently, instead
  of having 7 katuns in C2 D2 we have 17 (7 + 10) katuns. Compare C2 with
  figure <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>j-m</i>. In E1 F1, 15 tuns are
  recorded. The tun headdress in E1 gives the value 5 to the head there
  depicted (see fig. <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>n-s</i>) and the fleshless
  lower jaw adds 10, making the value of E1 15. Compare figure <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>b-e</i>, where examples of the head for 15 are
  given. Glyphs E2 and F2 represent 0 uinals and G1 H1 0 kins; note the
  clasped hand in E2 and G1, which denotes the 0 in each case. This whole
  number therefore reads 9.17.15.0.0. Reducing this to units of the first
  order by means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, we have:</p>

  The day sign in H2 is quite clearly the grotesque head variant for
  <b>Ahau</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>j'-k'</i>. The presence
  of the tun headdress in G2 indicates that the coefficient here recorded
  must have been either 5 or 15, depending on whether or not the lower part
  of the head originally had a fleshless lower jaw or not. In this
  particular case there is no room for doubt, since the numeral in G2 is a
  day coefficient, and day coefficients as stated in Chapter III, can never
  rise above 13. Consequently the number 15 can not be recorded in G2, and
  this form must stand for the number 5.</p>

  <p>Passing over I1 J1, I2 J2, K1 Ll, K2 L2, we reach in M1 the closing
  glyph of the Supplementary Series, here shown with a coefficient of 10,
  the head having a fleshless lower jaw. The month sign follows in N1. The
  coefficient is 3 and by comparing the sign itself with the month glyphs
  in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, it will be apparent that the sign for
  <b>Muan</b> in <i>a'</i> or <i>b'</i> is recorded here. The Initial
  Series of this monument therefore is 9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3
  Muan</b>.</p>

  <p>In closing the presentation of Initial-series texts which show both
  head-variant numerals and period glyphs, the writer has thought best to
  figure the Initial Series on Stela 15 at Copan, because it is not only
  the oldest Initial Series at Copan, but also the oldest one known in
  which head-variant numerals are used<a name="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> (see pl. <a href="#plate13">13</a>).
  The introducing glyph appears at A1-B2. There follows in A3 a number too
  much effaced to read, but which, on the basis of all our previous
  experience, we are justified in calling 9. Similarly B3 must be the head
  variant of the cycle sign. The numeral 4 is clearly recorded in A4. Note
  the square irid, protruding fang, and mouth curl. Compare A4 with figure
  <a href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>j-m</i>. Although the glyph in B4 is too much
  effaced to read, we are justified in assuming that it is the head variant
  of the katun sign. The glyph in A5 is the numeral 10. Note the fleshless
  lower jaw and other characteristics of the death's-head. Again we are
  justified in assuming that B5 must be the head variant of the tun sign.
  The glyphs A6, B6 clearly record 0 uinals. Note the clasped hand denoting
  zero in A6, and the curling mouth fang of the uinal period glyph in B6.
  This latter glyph is the full-figure form of the uinal sign<a
  name="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> (a frog). Compare B6
  with figure <a href="#fig33">33</a>, which shows the uinal sign on Stela
  D at Copan. The stela is broken off just below the uinal sign and its
  coefficient; and therefore the kin coefficient and sign, the day
  coefficient and sign, and the month coefficient and sign, are missing.
  Assembling the four periods present, we have 9.4.10.0.?. Calling the
  missing kin coefficient 0, and reducing this number to units of the first
  order by means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, we have:</p>

  safe assumption, since when the tun coefficient is either 0, 5, 10, or 15
  (as here) and the uinal coefficient is 0 (as here), the kin coefficient
  is almost invariably zero. That is, the close of an even hotun in the
  Long Count is recorded.</p>

  <p>While at Copan in May, 1912, the writer was shown a fragment of a
  stela which he was told was a part of this monument (Stela 15). This
  showed the top parts of two consecutive glyphs, the first of which very
  clearly had a coefficient of 12 and the one following of 8. The glyphs to
  which these coefficients belonged were missing, but the coincidence of
  the two numbers 12 (?) 8 (?) was so striking when taken into
  consideration with the fact that these were the day and month
  coefficients reached by calculation, that the writer was inclined to
  accept this fragment as the missing part of Stela 15 which showed the
  terminal date. This whole Initial Series therefore reads: 9.4.10.0.0
  <b>12 Ahau 8 Mol</b>. It is chiefly interesting because it shows the
  earliest use of head-variant numerals known.</p>

  <p>In the foregoing texts plate <a href="#plate12">12</a>, <i>A</i>,

  9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18 have been given, and, excepting the forms
  for 2, 11, and 12, these include examples of all the head numerals.<a
  name="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> No more texts
  specially illustrating this type of numeral will be presented, but when
  any of the head numerals not figured above (2, 7, 11, 12, 16, and 19)
  occur in future texts their presence will be noted.</p>

  <p>Before taking up the consideration of unusual or irregular Initial
  Series the writer has thought best to figure one Initial Series the
  period glyphs and numerals of which are expressed by full-figure forms.
  As mentioned on page <a href="#page68">68</a>, such inscriptions are
  exceedingly rare, and such glyphs, moreover, are essentially the same as
  head-variant forms, since their determining characteristics are
  restricted to their head parts, which are exactly like the corresponding
  head-variant forms. This fact will greatly aid the student in identifying
  the full-figure glyphs in the following text.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate14">14</a> is figured the Initial Series from
  Stela D at Copan.<a name="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a>
  The introducing glyph is recorded in A1. The variable central element in
  keeping with the other glyphs of the inscription appears here as a full
  figure, the lower part of which is concealed by the tun-sign.<a

  <p>The Initial-series number itself appears in B1-B3. The cycle sign is a
  grotesque bird, designated by Mr. Bowditch a parrot, an identification
  which the hooked beak and claws strongly suggest. The essential element
  of the cycle sign, however, the clasped hand, appears only in the head of
  this bird, where the student will readily find it. Indeed, the head of
  this full-figure form is nothing more nor less than a head-variant cycle
  glyph, and as such determines the meaning of the whole figure. Compare
  this head with figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>, <i>d-f</i>, or with any of
  the other head-variant cycle forms figured in the preceding texts. This
  grotesque "cycle bird," perhaps the parrot, is bound to the back of an
  anthropomorphic figure, which we have every reason to suppose records the
  cycle coefficient. An examination of this figure will show that it has
  not only the dots on the lower part of the cheek, but also the beard,
  both of which are distinctive features of the head for 9. Compare this
  head with figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>g-l</i>, or with any other
  head variants for the numeral 9 already figured. Bearing in mind that the
  heads only present the determining characteristics of full-figure glyphs,
  the student will easily identify B1 as recording 9 cycles.</p>

  <p>The katun and its coefficient are represented in A2, the former by a
  grotesque bird, an eagle according to Mr. Bowditch, and the latter by
  another anthropomorphic figure. The period glyph shows no essential
  element recognizable as such, and its identification as the katun sign
  therefore rests on its position, immediately following the cycle sign.
  The head of the full figure, which represents the katun coefficient,
  shows the essential element of the head for 5, the tun headdress. It has
  also the fleshless lower jaw of the head for 10. The combination of these
  two elements in one head, as we have seen, indicates the numeral 15, and
  A2 therefore records 15 katuns. Compare the head of this anthropomorphic
  figure with figure <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>b-e</i>.</p>

  <p>The tun and its coefficient are represented in B2. The former again
  appears as a grotesque bird, though in this case of undetermined nature.
  Its head, however, very clearly shows the essential element of the
  head-variant tun sign, the fleshless lower jaw. Compare this form with
  figure <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>e-g</i>, and the other head-variant
  tun signs already illustrated. The head of the anthropomorphic figure,
  which denotes the tun coefficient, is just like the head of the
  anthropomorphic figure in the preceding glyph (A2), except that in B2 the
  head has no fleshless lower jaw.</p>

  <p>Since the head in A2 with the fleshless lower jaw and the tun
  headdress represents the numeral 15, the head in B2 without the former
  but with the latter represents the numeral 5. Compare the head of the
  anthropomorphic figure in B2 with figure <a href="#fig51">51</a>,
  <i>n-s</i>. It is clear, therefore, that 5 tuns are recorded in B2.</p>

  <p>The uinal and its coefficient in A3 are equally clear. The period
  glyph here appears as a frog (Maya, <i>uo</i>), which, as we have seen
  <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>elsewhere, may have been chosen to
  represent the 20-day period because of the similarity of its name,
  <i>uo</i>, to the name of this period, <i>u</i>, or uinal. The head of
  the anthropomorphic figure which clasps the frog's foreleg is the head
  variant for 0. Note the clasped hand across the lower part of the face,
  and compare this form with figure <a href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>s-w</i>.
  The whole glyph, therefore, stands for 0 uinals.</p>

  <p>In B3 are recorded the kin and its coefficient. The period glyph here
  is represented by an anthropomorphic figure with a grotesque head. Its
  identity, as representing the kins of this number, is better established
  from its position in the number than from its appearance, which is
  somewhat irregular. The kin coefficient is just like the uinal
  coefficient&mdash;an anthropomorphic figure the head of which has the
  clasped hand as its determining characteristic. Therefore B3 records 0
  kins.</p>

  <p>The whole number expressed by B1-B3 is 9.15.5.0.0; reducing this by
  means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a> to units of the first order,

  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a> respectively), to the remainder, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>10 Ahau 8 Chen</b>.</p>

  <p>The day part of this terminal date is recorded in A4. The day sign
  <b>Ahau</b> is represented as an anthropomorphic figure, crouching within
  the customary day-sign cartouche. The head of this figure is the familiar
  profile variant for the day sign <b>Ahau</b>, seen in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h', i'</i>. This cartouche is clasped by the
  left arm of another anthropomorphic figure, the day coefficient, the head
  of which is the skull, denoting the numeral 10. Note the fleshless lower
  jaw of this head and compare it with the same element in figure <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>. This glyph A4 records, therefore, the
  day reached by the Initial Series, <b>10 Ahau</b>.</p>

  <p>The position of the month glyph in this text is most unusual. Passing
  over B4, the first glyph of the Supplementary Series, the month glyph
  follows it immediately in A5. The month coefficient appears again as an
  anthropomorphic figure, the head of which has for its determining
  characteristic the forehead ornament composed of one part, denoting the
  numeral 8. Compare this head with the heads for 8, in figure <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>a-f</i>. The month sign itself appears as a
  large grotesque head, the details of which present the essential elements
  of the month here recorded&mdash;<b>Chen</b>. Compare with figure <a

  <p>The superfix of figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>o, p</i>, has been
  retained unchanged as the superfix in A5b. The element (*<img
  src="images/glyph191.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:8.29ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) appears just above the eye of the grotesque head, and the element
  (**) on the left-hand side about where the ear lobe should be. The whole
  glyph unmistakably records a head variant of the month glyph <b>Chen</b>,
  and this Initial Series therefore reads 9.15.5.0.0 <b>10 Ahau 8
  Chen</b>.</p>

  <p>The student will note that this Initial Series records a date just 5
  tuns later than the Initial Series on Stela B at Copan (pl. <a
  href="#plate7">7</a>, <i>A</i>). According to the writer's opinion,
  therefore, Stelæ B and D marked two successive hotuns at this city.</p>

  <p>We come now to the consideration of Initial Series which are either
  unusual or irregular in some respect, examples of which it is necessary
  to give in order to familiarize the student with all kinds of texts.</p>

  <p>The Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, <i>A</i>,<a
  name="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> is figured because of
  the very unusual order followed by its glyphs. The sequence in which
  these succeed each other is given in <i>B</i> of that plate. The scheme
  followed seems to have been that of a mat pattern. The introducing glyph
  appears in position 0 (pl. <a href="#plate15">15</a>, <i>B</i>), and the
  student will readily recognize it in the same position in <i>A</i> of the
  same plate. The Initial Series number follows in 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (pl.
  <a href="#plate15">15</a>, <i>B</i>). Referring to these corresponding
  positions in <i>A</i>, we find that 9 cycles are recorded in 1, and 13
  katuns in 2. At this point the diagonal glyph- band passes under another
  band, emerging at 3, where the tun sign with a coefficient of 10 is
  recorded. Here the band turns again and, crossing backward diagonally,
  shows 0 uinals in 4. At this point the band passes under three diagonals
  running in the opposite direction, emerging at position 5, the glyph in
  which are recorded 0 kins.</p>

  <p>This number 9.13.10.0.0 reduces by means of Table <a

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 73 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>7 Ahau 3 Cumhu</b>. Referring again to plate <a
  href="#plate15">15</a>, <i>B</i>, for the sequence of the glyphs in this
  text, it is clear that the day of this terminal date should be recorded
  in 6, immediately after the kins of the Initial-series number in 6. It
  will be seen, however, in plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, <i>A</i>, that
  <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>{192}</span>glyph 6 is effaced, and consequently the
  day is missing. Passing over 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, in <i>A</i> and
  <i>B</i> of the plate named, we reach in the lower half of 12 the closing
  glyph of the Supplementary Series here shown with a coefficient of 10.
  Compare this form with figure <a href="#fig65">65</a>. The month glyph,
  therefore, should follow in the upper half of 13.<a name="NtA_165"
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> This glyph is very clearly the form
  for the month <b>Cumhu</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g',
  h'</i>), and it seems to have attached to it the bar and dot coefficient
  8. A comparison of this with the month coefficient 3, determined above by
  calculation, shows that the two do not agree, and that the month
  coefficient as recorded exceeds the month coefficient determined by
  calculation, by 5, or in Maya notation, 1 bar. Since the Initial-series
  number is very clearly 9.13.10.0.0, and since this number leads to the
  terminal date <b>7 Ahau 3 Cumhu</b>, it would seem that the ancient
  scribes had made an error in this text, recording 1 bar and 3 dots
  instead of 3 dots alone. The writer is inclined to believe, however, that
  the bar here is only ornamental and has no numerical value whatsoever,
  having been inserted solely to balance this glyph. If it had been
  omitted, the month sign would have had to be greatly elongated and its
  proportions distorted in order to fill completely the space available.
  According to the writer's interpretation, this Initial Series reads
  9.13.10.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 3 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>The opposite face of the above-mentioned monument presents the same
  interlacing scheme, though in this case the glyph bands cross at right
  angles to each other instead of diagonally.</p>

  <p>The only other inscription in the whole Maya territory, so far as the
  writer knows, which at all parallels the curious interlacing pattern of
  the glyphs on the back of Stela J at Copan, just described, is Stela H at
  Quirigua, illustrated in figure <a href="#fig71">71</a>.<a name="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> The drawing of this inscription
  appears in a of this figure and the key to the sequence of the glyphs in
  <i>b</i>. The introducing glyph occupies position 1 and is followed by
  the Initial Series in 2-6. The student will have little difficulty in
  identifying 2, 3, and 4 as 9 cycles, 16 katuns, and 0 tuns, respectively.
  The uinal and kin glyphs in 5 and 6, respectively, are so far effaced
  that in order to determine the values of their coefficients we shall have
  to rely to a large extent on other inscriptions here at Quirigua. For
  example, every monument at Quirigua which presents an Initial Series
  marks the close of some particular hotun in the Long Count; consequently,
  all the Initial Series at Quirigua which record these Katun endings have
  0 for their uinal and kin coefficients.<a name="NtA_167"
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> This <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>absolute uniformity in
  regard to the uinal and kin coefficients in all the other Initial Series
  at Quirigua justifies the assumption that in the text here under
  discussion 0 uinals and 0 kins were originally recorded in glyphs 5 and
  6, respectively. Furthermore, an inspection of the coefficients of these
  two glyphs in figure <a href="#fig71">71</a>, <i>a</i>, shows that both
  of them are of the same general size and shape as the tun coefficient in
  4, which, as we have seen, is very clearly 0. It is more than probable
  that the uinal and kin coefficients in this text were originally 0, like
  the tun coefficient, and that through weathering they have been eroded
  down to their present shape. In figure <a href="#fig72">72</a>, <i>a</i>,
  is shown the tun coefficient and beside it in <i>b</i>, the uinal or kin
  coefficient. The dotted parts in <i>b</i> are the lines which have
  disappeared through erosion, if this coefficient was originally 0. It
  seems more than likely from the foregoing that the uinal and kin
  coefficients in this number were originally 0, and proceeding on this
  assumption, we have recorded in glyphs 2-6, figure <a
  href="#fig71">71</a>, <i>a</i>, the number 9.16.0.0.0.</p>

  <p>In spite of some weathering, the day part of the terminal date appears

  by calculations based on the assumption that the kin and uinal

  these assumptions. Passing over 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, we reach in
  15 the closing glyph of the Supplementary Series, and in 16 probably, the
  month glyph. This form, although badly eroded, presents no features
  either in the outline of its coefficient or in the sign itself which
  would prevent it representing the month part <b>13 Tzec</b>. The
  coefficient is just wide enough for three vertical divisions (2 bars and
  3 dots), and the month glyph itself is divided into two parts, a superfix
  comprising about one-third of the glyph and the main element the
  remaining two-thirds. Compare this form with the sign for <b>Tzec</b> in
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g, h</i>. Although this text is too
  much weathered to permit absolute certainty with reference to the reading
  of this Initial Series, the writer nevertheless believes that in all
  probability it records the date given above, namely, 9.16.0.0.0 <b>2 Ahau
  13 Tzec</b>. If this is so, Stela H is the earliest hotun-marker at
  Quirigua.<a name="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The student will have noticed from the foregoing texts, and it has
  also been stated several times, that the cycle coefficient is almost
  invariably 9. Indeed, the only two exceptions to this rule in the
  inscriptions already figured are the Initial Series from the Temples of
  the Foliated Cross and the Sun at Palenque (pl. <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, respectively), in which
  the cycle coefficient in each case was 1. As explained on page <a
  href="#page179">179</a>, footnote 1, these two Initial Series refer
  probably to mythological events, and the dates which they record were not
  contemporaneous with the erection of the temples on whose walls they are
  inscribed; and, finally, Cycle 9 was the first historic period of the
  Maya civilization, the epoch which witnessed the rise and fall of all the
  southern cities.</p>

  <p>As explained on page <a href="#page179">179</a>, footnote 2, however,
  there are one or two Initial Series which can hardly be considered as
  referring to mythological events, even though the dates which they record
  fall in a cycle earlier than Cycle 9. It was stated, further, in the same
  place that these two Initial Series were not found inscribed on large
  monuments but on smaller antiquities, one of them being a small nephrite
  figure which has been designated the Tuxtla Statuette, and the other a
  nephrite plate, designated the Leyden Plate; and, finally, that the dates
  recorded on these two antiquities probably designated contemporaneous
  events in the historic period of the Maya civilization. <!-- Page 195

  <p>These two minor antiquities have several points in common. Both are
  made of the same material (nephrite) and both have their glyphs incised
  instead of carved. More important, however, than these similarities is
  the fact that the Initial Series recorded on each of them has for its
  cycle coefficient the numeral 8; in other words, both record dates which
  fell in the cycle immediately preceding that of the historic period, or
  Cycle 9. Finally, at least one of these two Initial Series (that on the
  Leyden Plate), if indeed not both, records a date so near the opening of
  the historic period, which we may assume occurred about 9.0.0.0.0 <b>8
  Ahau 13 Ceh</b> in round numbers, that it may be considered as belonging
  to the historic period, and hence constitutes the earliest historical
  inscription from the Maya territory. <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span></p>

  <p>The Initial Series on the first of these minor antiquities, the Tuxtla
  Statuette, is shown in figure <a href="#fig73">73</a>.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> The student will note at the outset
  one very important difference between this Initial Series&mdash;if indeed
  it is one, which some have doubted&mdash;and those already presented. No
  period glyphs appear in the present example, and consequently the
  Initial-series number is expressed by the second method (p. <a
  href="#page129">129</a>), that is, numeration by position, as in the
  codices. See the discussion of Initial Series in the codices in Chapter
  VI (pp. <a href="#page266">266</a>-<a href="#page273">273</a>), and
  plates 31 and 32. This at once distinguishes the Initial Series on the
  Tuxtla Statuette from every other Initial Series in the inscriptions now
  known. The number is preceded by a character which bears some general
  resemblance to the usual Initial-series introducing glyph. See figure <a
  href="#fig74">74</a>. The most striking point of similarity is the trinal
  superfix, which is present in both signs. The student will have little
  difficulty in reading the number here recorded as 8 cycles, 6 katuns, 2
  tuns, 4 uinals, and 17 kins, that is, 8.6.2.4.17; reducing this to units
  of the first order by means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, we

  <p>Solving this Initial-series number for its terminal date, it will be
  found to be <b>8 Caban 0 Kankin</b>. Returning once more to our text (see
  fig. <a href="#fig73">73</a>), we find the day coefficient above reached,
  8, is recorded just below the 17 kins and appears to be attached to some
  character the details of which are, unfortunately, effaced. The month
  coefficient 0 and the month sign <b>Kankin</b> do not appear in the
  accompanying text, at least in recognizable form. This Initial Series
  would seem to be, therefore, 8.6.2.4.17 <b>8 Caban 0 Kankin</b>, of which
  the day sign, month coefficient, and month sign are effaced or
  unrecognizable. In spite of its unusual form and the absence of the day
  sign, and the month coefficient and sign the writer is inclined to accept
  the above date as a contemporaneous Initial Series.<a name="NtA_170"

  satisfactory than the one just described, and <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span>its authenticity,
  generally speaking, is unquestioned. The student will easily identify
  A1-B2 as an Initial-series introducing glyph, even though the pair of
  comblike appendages flanking the central element and the tun tripod are
  both wanting. Compare this form with figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>. The
  Initial-series number, expressed by normal-form numerals and head-variant
  period glyphs, follows in A3-A7. The former are all very clear, and the
  number may be read from them in spite of certain irregularities in the
  corresponding period glyphs. For example, the katun head in A4 has the
  clasped hand, which is the distinguishing characteristic of the cycle
  head, and as such should have appeared in the head in A3. Neither the tun
  head in A5 nor the kin head in A7 shows an essential element heretofore
  found distinguishing these particular period glyphs. Indeed, the only
  period glyph of the five showing the usual essential element is the uinal
  head in A6, where the large mouth curl appears very clearly. However, the
  number recorded here may be read as 8.14.3.1.12 from the sequence of the
  coefficients&mdash;that is, their position with reference to the
  introducing glyph&mdash;a reading, moreover, which is confirmed by the
  only known period glyph, the uinal sign, standing in the fourth position
  after the introducing glyph. <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>1 Eb 0 Yaxkin</b>. The day part of this date is
  very clearly recorded in A8, the coefficient 1 being expressed by one
  dot, and the day sign itself having the hook surrounded by dots, and the
  prominent teeth, both of which are characteristic of the grotesque head
  which denotes the day <b>Eb</b>. See figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>,
  <i>s-u</i>.</p>

  <p>The month glyph appears in A9a, the lower half of which unmistakably
  records the month <b>Yaxkin</b>. (See fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k,
  l</i>.) Note the <i>yax</i> and <i>kin</i> elements in each. The only
  difficulty here seems to be the fact that a bar (5) is attached to this
  glyph. The writer believes, however, that the unexplained element (*<img
  src="images/glyph198.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.14ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) is the month coefficient in this text, and that it is an archaic form
  for 0. He would explain the bar as being merely ornamental. The whole
  Initial Series reads: 8.14.3.1.12 <b>1 Eb 0 Yaxkin</b>.</p>

  <p>The fact that there are some few irregularities in this text confirms
  rather than invalidates the antiquity which has been ascribed to it by
  the writer. Dating from the period when the Maya were just emerging from
  savagery to the arts and practices of a semicivilized state, it is not at
  all surprising that this inscription should reflect the crudities and
  uncertainties of its time. Indeed, it is quite possible that at the very
  early period from which it probably dates (8.14.3.1.12 <b>1 Eb 0
  Yaxkin</b>) the period glyphs had not yet become sufficiently
  conventionalized to show individual peculiarities, and their identity may
  have been determined solely by their position with reference to the
  introducing glyph, as seemingly is the case in some of the period glyphs
  of this text.</p>

  <p>The Initial Series on the Leyden Plate precedes the Initial Series on
  Stela 3 at Tikal, the earliest contemporaneous date from the monuments,
  by more than 160 years, and with the possible exception of the Tuxtla
  Statuette above described, probably records the earliest date of Maya
  history. It should be noted here that Cycle-8 Initial Series are
  occasionally found in the Dresden Codex, though none are quite so early
  as the Initial Series from the Tuxtla Statuette. <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span></p>

  <p>Passing over the Initial Series whose cycle coefficient is 9, many of
  which have already been described, we come next to the consideration of
  Initial Series whose cycle coefficient is 10, a very limited number
  indeed. As explained in Chapter I, the southern cities did not long
  survive the opening of Cycle 10, and since Initial-series dating did not
  prevail extensively in the later cities of the north, Initial Series
  showing 10 cycles are very unusual.</p>

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig75">75</a>, <i>B</i>, is shown the Initial
  Series from the Temple of the Initial Series at Chichen Itza, the great
  metropolis of northern Yucatan. This inscription is not found on a stela
  but on the under side of a lintel over a doorway leading into a small and
  comparatively insignificant temple. The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2 and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-A5. The student
  will have little difficulty in deciphering all of the coefficients except
  that belonging to the kin in A5, which is a head-variant numeral, and the
  whole number will be found to read 10.2.9.1.?. The coefficient of the day
  of the terminal date is very clearly 9 (see B5) and the month part, <b>7
  Zac</b> (see A6). We may now read this Initial Series as 10.2.9.1.? 9?
  <b>7 Zac</b>; in other words, the kin coefficient and the day sign are
  still indeterminate. First substituting 0 as the missing value of the kin
  coefficient, the terminal date reached will be 10.2.9.1.0 <b>13 Ahau 18
  Yax</b>. But according to Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a>, position <b>18
  Yax</b> is just 9 days earlier than position <b>7 Zac</b>, the month part
  recorded in A6. Consequently, in order to reach <b>7 Zac</b> from
  10.2.9.1.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Yax</b>, 9 more days are necessary. Counting
  these forward from 10.2.9.1.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Yax</b>, the date reached

  <p>Two other Initial Series whose cycle coefficient is 10 yet remain to
  be considered, namely, Stelæ 1 and 2 at Quen Santo.<a name="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> The first of these is shown in figure
  <a href="#fig76">76</a>, A, but unfortunately only a fragment of this
  monument has been recovered. In A1-B2 appears a perfectly regular form of
  the introducing glyph (see fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>), and this is
  followed in A3-B4 by the Initial-series number itself, with the exception
  of the kin, the glyph representing which has been broken off. The student
  will readily identify A3 as 10 cycles, noting the clasped hand on the
  head-variant period glyph, and B3 as 2 katuns. The glyph in A4 has very
  clearly the coefficient 5, and even though it does not seem to have the
  fleshless lower jaw of the tun head, from its position alone&mdash;after
  the unmistakable katun sign in B3 we are perfectly justified in assuming
  that 5 tuns are recorded here. Both the coefficient and the glyph in B4
  are unfamiliar. However, as the former must be one of the numerals 0 to
  19, inclusive, since it is not one of the numerals 1 to 19, inclusive, it
  is clear that it must be a new form for 0. The sign to which it is
  attached bears no resemblance to either the normal form for the uinal or
  the head variant; but since it occupies the 4th position after the
  introducing glyph, B4, we are justified in assuming that 0 uinals are
  recorded here. Beyond this we can not proceed with certainty, though the
  values for the missing parts suggested below are probably those recorded
  on the lost fragments of the monument. As recorded in A3-B4 this number
  reads 10.2.5.0.?. Now, if we assume that the missing term is filled with
  0, we shall have recorded the end of an even hotun in the Long Count, and
  this monument becomes a regular hotun-marker. That this monument was a
  hotun-marker is corroborated by the fact that Stela 2 from Quen Santo
  very clearly records the close of the hotun next after 10.2.5.0.0, which
  the writer believes this monument marks. For <!-- Page 201 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span>this reason it seems
  probable that the glyph which stood in A5 recorded 0 kins.</p>

  originally recorded on this monument was probably 10.2.5.0.0 <b>9 Ahau 18
  Yax</b>.</p>

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig76">76</a>, <i>B</i>, is shown Stela 2 from
  Quen Santo. The workmanship on this monument is somewhat better than on
  Stela 1 and, moreover, its Initial Series is complete. The introducing
  glyph appears in A1-B2 and is followed by the Initial-series number in
  A3-A5. Again, 10 cycles are very clearly recorded in A3, the clasped hand
  of the cycle head still appearing in spite of the weathering of this
  glyph. The katun sign in B3 is almost entirely effaced, though sufficient
  traces of its coefficient remain to enable us to identify it as 2. Note
  the position of the uneffaced dot with reference to the horizontal axis
  of the glyph. Another dot the same distance above the axis would come as
  near the upper left-hand corner of the glyph-block as the uneffaced dot
  does to the lower left-hand corner. Moreover, if 3 had been recorded here
  the uneffaced dot would have been nearer the bottom. It is clear that 1
  and 4 are quite out of the question and that 2 remains the only possible
  value of the numeral here. We are justified in assuming that the effaced
  period glyph was the katun sign. In A4 10 tuns are very clearly recorded;
  note the fleshless lower jaw of the tun head. The uinal head with its
  characteristic mouth curl appears in B4. The coefficient of this latter
  glyph is identical with the uinal coefficient in the preceding text (see
  fig. <a href="#fig76">76</a>, <i>A</i>) in B4, which we there identified
  as a form for 0. Therefore we must make the same identification here, and
  B4 then becomes 0 uinals. From its position, if not from its appearance,
  we are justified in designating the glyph in A5 the head for the kin
  period; since the coefficient attached to this head is the same as the
  one in the preceding glyph (B4), we may therefore conclude that 0 kins
  are recorded here. The whole number expressed in A3-A5 is <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span>therefore
  10.2.10.0.0. Reducing this to units of the first order by means of Table

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 76 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>2 Ahau 13 Chen</b>. Although the day sign in B5
  is effaced, the coefficient 2 appears quite clearly. The month glyph is
  recorded in A6. The student will have little difficulty in restoring the
  coefficient as 13, and the month glyph is certainly either <b>Chen, Yax,
  Zac</b>, or <b>Ceh</b> (compare fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>o</i>
  and <i>p</i>, <i>q</i> and <i>r</i>, <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, and <i>u</i>
  and <i>v</i>, respectively). Moreover, since the month coefficient is 13,
  the day sign in B5 can have been only <b>Chicchan, Oc, Men</b>, or
  <b>Ahau</b> (see Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a>); since the kin
  coefficient in A5 is 0, the effaced day sign must have been <b>Ahau</b>.
  Therefore the Initial Series on Stela 2 at Quen Santo reads 10.2.10.0.0
  <b>2 Ahau 13 Chen</b> and marked the hotun immediately following the
  hotun commemorated by Stela 1 at the same site.</p>

  <p>The student will note also that the date on Stela 2 at Quen Santo is
  less than a year later than the date recorded by the Initial Series on
  the Temple lintel from Chichen Itza (see fig. <a href="#fig75">75</a>,
  <i>B</i>). And a glance at the map in plate <a href="#plate1">1</a> will
  show, further, that Chichen Itza and Quen Santo are separated from each
  other by almost the entire length (north and south) of the Maya
  territory, the former being in the extreme northern part of Yucatan and
  the latter considerably to the south of the central Maya cities. The
  presence of two monuments so close together chronologically and yet so
  far apart geographically is difficult to explain. Moreover, the problem
  is further complicated by the fact that not one of the many cities lying
  between has yielded thus far a date as late as either of these.<a
  name="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> The most logical
  explanation of this interesting phenomenon seems to be that while the
  main body of the Maya moved northward into Yucatan after the collapse of
  the southern cities others retreated southward into the highlands of
  Guatemala; that while the northern emigrants <!-- Page 203 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>{203}</span>were colonizing Yucatan
  the southern branch was laying the foundation of the civilization which
  was to flourish later under the name of the Quiche and other allied
  peoples; and finally, that as Chichen Itza was a later northern city, so
  Quen Santo was a later southern site, the two being at one period of
  their existence at least approximately contemporaneous, as these two
  Initial Series show.</p>

  <p>It should be noted in this connection that Cycle-10 Initial Series are
  occasionally recorded in the Dresden Codex, though the dates in these
  cases are all later than those recorded on the Chichen Itza lintel and
  the Quen Santo stelæ. Before closing the presentation of Initial-series
  texts it is first necessary to discuss two very unusual and highly
  irregular examples of this method of dating, namely, the Initial Series
  from the east side of Stela C at Quirigua and the Initial Series from the
  tablet in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque. The dates recorded in
  these two texts, so far as known,<a name="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> are the only ones which are not
  counted from the starting point of Maya chronology, the date <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig77">77</a>, <i>A</i>, is shown the Initial
  Series on the east side of Stela C at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2, and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-A5. The student
  will easily read this as 13.0.0.0.0. Reducing this number to units of the

  will be well to accept the correctness of this text only with a
  reservation. The most we can say at present is that if the number

  <p>Let us next examine the Initial Series on the tablet from the Temple
  of the Cross at Palenque, which is shown in figure <a
  href="#fig77">77</a>, <i>B</i>.<a name="NtA_178"
  href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2, and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-B7. The period
  glyphs in B3, B4, B5, B6, and B7 are all expressed by their corresponding
  normal forms, which will be readily recognized. Passing over the cycle
  coefficient in A3 for the present, it is clear that the katun coefficient
  in A4 is 19. Note the dots around the mouth, characteristic of the head
  for 9 (fig. <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>g-l</i>), and the fleshless lower
  jaw, the essential element of the head for 10 (fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>m-r</i>). The combination of the two gives the
  head in A4 the value of 19. The tun coefficient in A5 is equally clear as
  13. Note the banded headdress, characteristic of the head for 3 (fig. <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>, <i>h, i</i>), and the fleshless lower jaw of the 10
  head, the combination of the two giving the head for 13 (fig. <a
  href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>w</i>).<a name="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> The head for 4 and the hand zero sign
  appear as the coefficient of the uinal and kin signs in A6 and A7,
  respectively. The number will read, therefore, ?.19.13.4.0. Let us
  examine the cycle coefficient in A3 again. The natural assumption, of
  course, is that it is 9. But the dots characteristic of the head for 9
  are not to be found here. As this head has no fleshless lower jaw, it can
  not be 10 or any number above 13, and as there is no clasped hand
  associated with it, it can not signify 0, so we are limited to the
  numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,<a name="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13, as the
  numeral here recorded. Comparing this form with these numerals in figures
  <a href="#fig51">51</a> and <a href="#fig52">52</a>, it is evident that
  it can not be 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 13, and that it must therefore be
  2, 11, or 12. Substituting these three values in turn, we have
  2.19.13.4.0, 11.19.13.4.0, and 12.19.13.4.0 as the possible numbers
  recorded in A3-B7, and reducing these numbers to units of the first order
  and deducting the highest number of Calendar Rounds possible from each,
  and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to
  their remainders, the terminal dates reached will be:</p>

  <p>If this text is perfectly regular and our calculations are correct,
  one of these three terminal dates will be found recorded, and the value
  of the cycle coefficient in A3 can be determined.</p>

  <p>The terminal date of this Initial Series is recorded in A8-B9 and the
  student will easily read it as <b>8 Ahau 18 Tzec</b>. The only difference
  <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span>between the day coefficient and the month
  coefficient is that the latter has a fleshless lower jaw, increasing its
  value by 10. Moreover, comparison of the month sign in B9 with <i>g</i>
  and <i>h</i>, figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, shows unmistakably that the
  month here recorded is <b>Tzec</b>. But the terminal date as recorded
  does not agree with any one of the three above terminal dates as reached
  by calculation and we are forced to accept one of the two conclusions
  which confronted us in the preceding text (fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>,
  A): Either the starting point of this Initial Series is not the date <b>4
  Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, or there is some error in the original text.<a
  name="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Assuming that the ancient scribes made no mistakes in this
  inscription, let us count backward from the recorded terminal date, <b>8
  Ahau 18 Tzec</b>, each of the three numbers 2.19.13.4.0, 11.19.13.4.0,
  and 12.19.13.4.0, one of which, we have seen, is recorded in A3-B7.</p>

  <p>Reducing these numbers to units of the first order by means of Table
  <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, and deducting all the Calendar Rounds
  possible from each (see Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and, finally,
  applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively),
  to the remainders, the starting points will be found to be:</p>

<table class="mc">

<tr><td class="pr0"><b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b> </td><td class="ar pl025">for 12.19.13.4.0</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Which of these starting points are we to accept as the one from which
  this number is counted? The correct answer to this question will give at
  the same time the value of the cycle coefficient, which, as we have seen,
  must be 2, 11, or 12. Most Maya students have accepted as the starting
  point of this Initial-series number the last of the three dates above
  given, <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, which involves also the identification of
  the cycle coefficient in A3 as 12. The writer has reached the same
  conclusion from the following points:</p>

  <p>1. The cycle coefficient in A3, except for its very unusual headdress,
  is almost identical with the other two head-variant numerals, whose
  values are known to be 12. These three head numerals are shown side by
  side in figure <a href="#fig52">52</a>, <i>t-v, t</i> being the form in
  A3 above, inserted in this figure for the sake of comparison. Although
  these three heads show no single element or characteristic that is
  present in all (see p. <a href="#page100">100</a>), each is very similar
  to the other two and at the same time is dissimilar from all other
  head-variant numerals. This fact warrants the conclusion that the head in
  A3 represents the numeral 12, and if this is so the starting point of the
  Initial Series under discussion is <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>.</p>

  <p>2. Aside from the fact that 12 seems to be the best reading of the
  head in A3, and consequently that the starting point of this number is
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, the writer believes that <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>
  should be selected, if for no other reason than that another Initial
  Series has been found which proceeds from this same date, while no other
  Initial Series known is counted from either <b>7 Ahau 3 Mol</b> or <b>3
  Ahau 18 Mac</b>.</p>

  <p>As we have seen in discussing the preceding text, from the east side
  of Stela C at Quirigua (fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>, <i>A</i>), the
  Initial Series there recorded was counted from the same starting point,
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, as the Initial Series from the Temple of the Cross
  at Palenque, if we read the latter as 12.19.13.4.0. This coincidence, the
  writer believes, is sufficient to warrant the identification of the head
  in A3 (fig. <a href="#fig77">77</a>, <i>B</i>) as the head numeral 12 and
  the acceptance of this Initial Series as proceeding from the same
  starting point as the Quirigua text just described, namely, the date <b>4
  Ahau 8 Zotz</b>. With these two examples the discussion of Initial-series
  texts will be closed.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Initial Series and Secondary Series</span></p>

  <p>It has been explained (see pp. <a href="#page74">74</a>-<a
  href="#page76">76</a>) that in addition to Initial-series dating the Maya
  had another method of expressing their dates, known as Secondary Series,
  which was used when more than one date had to be recorded on the same
  monument. It was stated, further, that the accuracy of Secondary-series
  dating depended solely on the question whether or not the Secondary
  Series was referred to some date whose position in the Long Count was
  fixed either by the record of its Initial Series or in some other way.
  The next class of texts to be presented will be those showing the use of
  Secondary Series in connection with an Initial Series, by means of which
  the Initial-series values of the Secondary-series dates, that is, their
  proper positions in the Long Count, may be worked out even though they
  are not recorded in the text.</p>

  <p>The first example presented will be the inscription on Lintel 21 at
  Yaxchilan, which is figured in plate <a href="#plate16">16</a>.<a
  name="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> As usual, when an
  Initial Series is recorded, the introducing glyph opens the text and this
  sign appears in A1, being followed by the Initial-series number itself in
  B1-B3. This the student will readily decipher as 9.0.19.2.4, recording
  apparently a very early date in Maya history, within 20 years of
  9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, the date arbitrarily fixed by the writer
  as the opening of the first great period.</p>

  <p>Reducing this number by means of Table <a href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>
  to units of the first order<a name="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> and deducting all the Calendar Rounds
  possible, 68 (see Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), and applying rules
  1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>,
  and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to the remainder, the
  terminal date reached will be <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b>. This date the student
  will find recorded in A4 and A7a, glyph B6b being the month-sign
  "indicator," or the closing glyph of the <!-- Page 208 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>{208}</span>Supplementary Series,
  here shown with the coefficient 9. Compare the day sign in A4a with the
  sign for <b>Kan</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>f</i>, and the
  month sign in A7a with the sign for <b>Yax</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q, r</i>. We have then recorded in A1-A4<a
  name="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>, and A7a the
  Initial-series date 9.0.19.2.4 <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b>. At first sight it
  would appear that this early date indicates the time at or near which
  this lintel was inscribed, but a closer examination reveals a different
  condition. Following along through the glyphs of this text, there is
  reached in C3-C4 still another number in which the normal forms of the
  katun, tun, and uinal signs clearly appear in connection with bar and dot
  coefficients. The question at once arises, Has the number recorded here
  anything to do with the Initial Series, which precedes it at the
  beginning of this text?</p>

  <p>Let us first examine this number before attempting to answer the above
  question. It is apparent at the outset that it differs from the
  Initial-series numbers previously encountered in several respects:</p>

  <p>1. There is no introducing glyph, a fact which at once eliminates the
  possibility that it might be an Initial Series.</p>

  <p>2. There is no kin period glyph, the uinal sign in C3 having two
  coefficients instead of one.</p>

  <p>3. The order of the period glyphs is reversed, the highest period,
  here the katun, closing the series instead of commencing it as
  heretofore.</p>

  <p>It has been explained (see p. <a href="#page129">129</a>) that in
  Secondary Series the order of the period glyphs is almost invariably the
  reverse of that shown by the period glyphs in Initial Series; and
  further, that the former are usually presented as ascending series, that
  is, with the lowest units first, and the latter invariably as descending
  series, with the highest units first. It has been explained also (see p.
  <a href="#page128">128</a>) that in Secondary Series the kin period glyph
  is usually omitted, the kin coefficient being attached to the left of the
  uinal sign. Since both of these points (see 2 and 3, above) are
  characteristic of the number in C3-C4, it is probable that a Secondary
  Series is recorded here, and that it expresses 5 kins, 16 uinals, 1 tun,
  and 15 katuns. Reversing this, and writing it according to the notation
  followed by most Maya students (see p. <a href="#page138">138</a>,
  footnote 1), we have as the number recorded by C3-C4, 15.1.16.5.</p>

  <p>Reducing this number to units of the first order by means of Table <a
  href="#tableXIII">XIII</a>, we have:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> C4 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 15 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 7,200 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 108,000</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 108,685</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Since all the Calendar Rounds which this number contains, 5 (see <!--
  Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>Table
  <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>) may be deducted from it without affecting
  its value, we can further reduce it to 13,785 (108,685 <span
  class="nw">-</span> 94,900), and this will be the number used in the
  following calculations.</p>

  <p>It was stated (on p. <a href="#page135">135</a>) in describing the
  direction of the count that numbers are usually counted forward from the
  dates next preceding them in a text, although this is not invariably
  true. Applying this rule to the present case, it is probable that the
  Secondary-series number 15.1.16.5, which we have reduced to 13,785 units
  of the first order, is counted <i>forward</i> from the date <b>2 Kan 2
  Yax</b>, the one next preceding it in our text, a date, moreover, the
  Initial-series value of which is known.</p>

  <p>Remembering that this date <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b> is our new starting
  point, and that the count is forward, by applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), to 13,785, the new terminal date
  reached will be <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b>; and this date is recorded in
  C5-D5. Compare C5 with the sign for the day <b>Muluc</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>m, n</i>, and D5 with the sign for the month
  <b>Tzec</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g, h</i>. Furthermore,
  by adding the Secondary-series number 15.1.16.5 to 9.0.19.2.4 (the
  Initial-series number which fixes the position of the date <b>2 Kan 2
  Yax</b> in the Long Count), the Initial-series value of the terminal date
  of the Secondary Series (calculated and identified above as <b>7 Muluc 17
  Tzec</b>) can also be determined as follows:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">19.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 2.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">4</td> <td class="pr1"> <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b> </td><td class="ind1"> Initial Series</td></tr>

<td class="ind1"> Initial Series of the Secondary-series<br/>terminal date <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b></td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The student may verify the above calculations by treating 9.16.1.0.9
  as a new Initial-series number, and counting it forward from <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>, the starting point of Maya chronology. The terminal date
  reached will be found to be the same date as the one recorded in C5-D5,
  namely, <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b>.</p>

  <p>What is the meaning then of this text, which records two dates nearly
  300 years apart?<a name="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> It
  must be admitted at the outset that the nature of the events which
  occurred on these two dates, a matter probably set forth in the glyphs of
  unknown meaning in the text, is totally unknown. It is possible to gather
  from other sources, however, some little data concerning their
  significance. In the first place, 9.16.1.0.9 <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b> is
  almost surely the "contemporaneous date" of this lintel, the date
  indicating the time at or near which it was formally dedicated or put
  into use. This point is established almost to a certainty by the fact
  that all the other dates known at Yaxchilan are very much nearer to
  9.16.1.0.9 <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b> in point <!-- Page 210 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>of time than to
  9.0.19.2.4 <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b>, the Initial-series date recorded on this
  lintel. Indeed, while they range from 9 days<a name="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> to 75 years from the former, the one
  nearest the latter is more than 200 years later. This practically proves
  that 9.16.1.0.9 <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b> indicates the "contemporaneous
  time" of this lintel and that 9.0.19.2.4 <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b> referred to
  some earlier event which took place perhaps even before the founding of
  the city. And finally, since this inscription is on a lintel, we may
  perhaps go a step further and hazard the conclusion that 9.16.1.0.9 <b>7
  Muluc 17 Tzec</b> records the date of the erection of the structure of
  which this lintel is a part.</p>

  <p>We may draw from this inscription a conclusion which will be found to
  hold good in almost all cases, namely, that the last date in a text
  almost always indicates the "contemporaneous time" of the monument upon
  which it appears. In the present text, for example, the Secondary-series
  date <b>7 Muluc 17 Tzec</b>, the Initial-series value of which was found
  to be 9.16.1.0.9, is in all probability its contemporaneous date, or very
  near thereto. It will be well to remember this important point, since it
  enables us to assign monuments upon which several different dates are
  recorded to their proper periods in the Long Count.</p>

  <p>The next example illustrating the use of Secondary Series with an
  Initial Series is the inscription from Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, figured
  in plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>.<a name="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> The order of the glyphs in this text
  is somewhat irregular. It will be noted that there is an uneven number of
  glyph columns, so that one column will have to be read by itself. The
  natural assumption would be that A and B, C and D, and E and F are read
  together, leaving G, the last column, to be read by itself. This is not
  the case, however, for A, presenting the Initial Series, is read first,
  and then B C, D E, and F G, in pairs. The introducing glyph of the
  Initial Series appears in A1 and is followed by the Initial-series number
  9.12.2.0.16 in A2-A6. The student should be perfectly familiar by this
  time with the processes involved in counting this number from its
  starting point, and should have no difficulty in determing by calculation
  the terminal date recorded in A7, C2, namely, <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b>.<a
  name="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> Compare A7 with the
  sign for <b>Cib</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>z</i>, and C2
  with the sign for <b>Yaxkin</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k,

  <p>Passing over the glyphs in B3-E1, the meanings of which are unknown,
  we reach in D2 E2 a number showing very clearly the tun and uinal signs,
  the latter having two coefficients instead of one. Moreover, the order of
  these period glyphs is reversed, the lower standing first in the series.
  As explained in connection with the preceding text, these points are both
  characteristic of Secondary-series numbers, and we may conclude therefore
  that D2 E2 records a number of this kind. Finally, since the kin
  coefficient in Secondary Series usually appears on the left of the uinal
  sign, we may express this number in the commonly accepted notation as
  follows: 12.9.15. Reducing this to units of the first order, we have:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> E2 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 12 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 360 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 4,320</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 4,515</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Remembering that Secondary-series numbers are usually counted from the
  dates next preceding them in the texts, in this case <b>5 Cib 14
  Yaxkin</b>, and proceeding according to rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a
  href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), the terminal date of the
  Secondary Series reached will be <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b>, which is
  recorded in F1 G1, though unfortunately these glyphs are somewhat
  effaced. Moreover, since the position of <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b> in the
  Long Count is known, that is, its Initial-series value, it is possible to
  determine the Initial-series value of this new date, <b>9 Chuen 9
  Kankin</b>:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 2.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">16</td> <td> <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b></td></tr>

</table>

  <p>But the end of this text has not been reached with the date <b>9 Chuen
  9 Kankin</b> in F1 G1. Passing over F2 G2, the meanings of which are
  unknown, we reach in F3 an inverted <b>Ahau</b> with the coefficient 5
  above it. As explained on page <a href="#page72">72</a>, this probably
  signifies 5 kins, the inversion of the glyph changing its meaning from
  that of a particular day sign, <b>Ahau</b>, to a general sign for the kin
  day period (see fig. <a href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>d</i>). The writer
  recalls but one other instance in which the inverted <b>Ahau</b> stands
  for the kin sign&mdash;on the north side of Stela C at Quirigua.</p>

  <p>We have then another Secondary-series number consisting of 5 kins,
  which is to be counted from some date, and since Secondary-series numbers
  are usually counted from the date next preceding them in the text, we are
  justified in assuming that <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b> is our new starting
  point.</p>

  <p>Counting 5 forward from this date, according to rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp.
  <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), the terminal date reached will be
  <b>1 Cib 14 Kankin</b>, and this latter date is recorded in G3-G4.
  Compare G3 with the sign for <b>Cib</b> in A7 and in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>z</i>, and G4 with the sign for <b>Kankin</b> in
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>y, z</i>. Moreover, since the
  Initial-series value of <b>9 Chuen 9 Kankin</b> was calculated above as
  9.12.14.10.11, <!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>the Initial-series value of this new date,
  <b>1 Cib 14 Kankin</b>, also can be calculated from it:</p>

<table class="mc">

</table>

  <p>Passing over G5 as unknown, we reach in G6-G7 another Secondary-series
  number. The student will have little difficulty in identifying G6 as 2
  uinals, 5 kins, and G7 as 1 katun. It will be noted that no tun sign
  appears in this number, which is a very unusual condition. By far the
  commoner practice in such cases in which 0 units of some period are
  involved is to record the period with a coefficient 0. However, this was
  not done in the present case, and since no tuns are recorded, we may
  conclude that none were involved, and G6-G7 may be written 1.(0).2.5.
  Reducing this number to units of the first order, we have:</p>

  <p>We have recorded here four different dates, of which the last,
  9.13.14.13.1 <b>5 Imix 19 Zac</b>, probably represents the actual date,
  or very near thereto, of this monument.<a name="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> The period covered between the first
  and last of these dates is about 32 years, within the range of a single
  lifetime or, indeed, of the tenure of some important office by a single
  individual. The unknown glyphs again probably set forth the nature of the
  events which occurred on the dates recorded.</p>

  <p>In the two preceding texts the Secondary Series given are regular in
  every way. Not only was the count forward each time, but it also started
  in every case from the date immediately preceding the number counted.
  This regularity, however, is far from universal in Secondary-series
  texts, and the following examples comprise some of the more common
  departures from the usual practice.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate18">18</a> is figured the Initial Series from
  Stela K at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>
  The text opens on the north side of this monument (see pl. <a
  href="#plate18">18</a>, <i>A</i>) with the introducing glyph in A1-B2.
  This is followed by the Initial-series number 9.18.15.0.0 in A3-B4, which
  leads to the terminal date <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>. The day part of this date
  the student will find recorded in its regular position, A5a. Passing over
  A5b and B5, the meanings of which are unknown, we reach in A6 a
  Secondary-series number composed very clearly of 10 uinals and 10 kins
  (10.10), which reduces to the following number of units of the first
  order:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> A6 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 10 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 20 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0"> A6 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 10 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 1 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 10</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> &mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 210</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The first assumption is that this number is counted forward from the
  terminal date of the Initial Series, <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>, and performing
  the operations indicated in rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a
  href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) the terminal date reached will be
  <b>5 Oc 8 Uo</b>. Now, although the day sign in B6b is clearly <b>Oc</b>
  (see fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>o-q</i>), its coefficient is very
  clearly 1, not 5, and, moreover, the month in A7a is unmistakably <b>18
  Kayab</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>). Here then
  instead of finding the date determined by calculation, <b>5 Oc 8 Uo</b>,
  the date recorded is <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b>, and consequently there is some
  departure from the practices heretofore encountered.</p>

  <p>Since the association of the number 10.10 is so close with (1) the
  terminal date of the Initial Series, <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>, and (2) the
  date <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b> almost immediately following it, it would
  almost seem as though these two dates must be the starting point and
  terminal date, respectively, of this number. If the count is forward, we
  have just proved that this can not be the case; so let us next count the
  <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>number backward and see whether we can
  reach the date recorded in B6b-A7a (<b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b>) in this
  way.</p>

  <p>Counting 210 <i>backward</i> from <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>, according to
  rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively),
  the terminal date reached will be <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b>, as recorded in
  B6b-A7. In other words, the Secondary Series in this text is counted
  backward from the Initial Series, and therefore precedes it in point of
  time. This will appear from the Initial-series value of <b>1 Oc 18
  Kayab</b>, which may be determined by calculation:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">18.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">15.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0</td> <td> <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b> </td></tr>

</table>

  <p>This text closes on the south side of the monument in a very unusual
  manner (see pl. <a href="#plate18">18</a>, <i>B</i>). In B3a appears the
  month-sign indicator, here recorded as a head variant with a coefficient
  10, and following immediately in B3b a Secondary-series number composed
  of 0 uinals and 0 kins, or, in other words, nothing. It is obvious that
  in counting this number 0.0, or nothing, either backward or forward from
  the date next preceding it in the text, <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b> in B6b-A7a
  on the north side of the stela, the same date <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b> will
  remain. But this date is not repeated in A4, where the terminal date of
  this Secondary Series, 0.0, seems to be recorded. However, if we count
  0.0 from the terminal date of the Initial Series, <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>, we
  reach the date recorded in A4, <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>,<a name="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> and this whole text so far as
  deciphered will read:</p>

  <p>The reason for recording a Secondary-series number equal to zero, the
  writer believes, was because the first Secondary-series date <b>1 Oc 18
  Kayab</b> precedes the Initial-series date, which in this case marks the
  time at which this monument was erected. Hence, in order to have the
  closing date on the monument record the contemporaneous time of the
  monument, it was necessary to repeat the Initial-series date; this was
  accomplished by adding to it a Secondary-series date denoting zero. Stela
  K is the next to the latest hotun-marker at Quirigua following
  immediately Stela I, the Initial series of which marks the hotun ending
  9.18.10.0.0 <b>10 Ahau 8 Zac</b> (see pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>,
  <i>C</i>).</p>

  <p>Mr. Bowditch (1910: p. 208) has advanced a very plausible explanation
  to account for the presence of the date 9.18.14.7.10 <b>1 Oc 18 Kayab</b>
  <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>{215}</span>on this monument. He shows that at the
  time when Stela K was erected, namely, 9.18.15.0.0 <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b>,
  the official calendar had outrun the seasons by just 210 days, or exactly
  the number of days recorded in A6, plate <a href="#plate18">18</a>, A
  (north side); and further, that instead of being the day <b>3 Yax</b>,
  which occurred at Quirigua about the beginning of the dry season,<a
  name="NtA_193" href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> in reality the season
  was 210 days behind, or at <b>18 Kayab</b>, about the beginning of the
  rainy season. This very great discrepancy between calendar and season
  could not have escaped the notice of the priests, and the 210 days
  recorded in A6 may well represent the days actually needed on the date
  9.18.15.0.0 <b>3 Ahau 3 Yax</b> to bring the calendar into harmony with
  the current season. If this be true, then the date 9.18.14.7.0 <b>1 Oc 18
  Kayab</b> represented the day indicated by the sun when the calendar
  showed that the 3d hotun in Katun 18 of Cycle 9 had been completed. Mr.
  Bowditch suggests the following free interpretation of this passage: "The
  sun has just set at its northern point<a name="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> and we are counting the day <b>3
  Yax</b>&mdash;210 days from <b>18 Kayab</b>&mdash;which is the true date
  in the calendar according to our traditions and records for the sun to
  set at this point on his course." As stated above, the writer believes
  this to be the true explanation of the record of 210 days on this
  monument.</p>

  Initial-series number 9.16.5.0.0 follows in A4-B8. This leads to the
  terminal date <b>8 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, which is recorded in A9, B9, B13, the
  glyph in A13 being the month-sign indicator here shown with the

  in A1-B9, B13, is perfectly regular and reads as follows: 9.16.5.0.0 <b>8

    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 79. The
    Secondary Series on Stela J, Quirigua.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The first Secondary Series inscribed on this monument (see fig. <a
  href="#fig79">79</a>, <i>A</i>) is at B1-B2. This series the student
  should readily decipher as 3 kins, 13 uinals, 11 tuns, and 0 katuns,
  which we may write 0.11.13.3. This number presents one feature, which, so
  far as the writer knows, is unique in the whole range of Maya texts. The
  highest order of units actually involved in this number is the tun, but
  for some unknown reason the ancient scribe saw fit to add the katun sign
  also, B2, which, however, he proceeded to nullify at once by attaching to
  it the coefficient 0. For in so far as the numerical value is concerned,
  11.13.3 and 0.11.13.3 are equal. The next peculiarity is that the date
  which follows this number in B3-A4 is not its terminal date, as we have
  every reason to expect, but, on the contrary, its starting point. In
  other words, in this Secondary Series the starting point follows instead
  of precedes the number counted from it. This date is very clearly <b>12
  Caban 5 Kayab</b>; compare B3 with the sign for <b>Caban</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a', b'</i>, and A4 with the sign for
  <b>Kayab</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>. So far as
  Stela J is concerned there is no record of the position which this date
  occupied in the Long Count; that is, there are no data by means of which
  its Initial Series may be calculated. Elsewhere at Quirigua, however,
  this date is recorded twice as an Initial Series and in each place it has
  the same value, 9.14.13.4.17. We may safely conclude, therefore, that the
  date in A3-B4 is 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, and use it in our
  calculations as such. Reducing 0.11.13.3 to units of the first order, we
  have:</p>

  which is nowhere recorded in the text (see fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a>,

  <p>The Initial Series corresponding to this date, however, may be

  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>:</p>

  <p>Although the date 9.15.5.0.0 <b>10 Ahau 8 Chen</b> is not actually
  recorded at Quirigua, it is reached on another monument by calculation
  just as here. It has a peculiar fitness here on Stela J in that it is
  just one katun earlier than the Initial Series on this monument (see fig.
  <a href="#fig78">78</a>), 9.16.5.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>.</p>

  <p>The other Secondary Series on this monument (see fig. <a
  href="#fig79">79</a>, <i>B</i>) appears at B1-A2, and records 18 tuns, 3
  uinals, and 14 kins, which we may write thus: 18.3.14. As in the
  preceding case, the date following this number in B2-A3 is its starting
  point, not its terminal date, a very unusual feature, as has been
  explained. This date is <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>&mdash;compare B2 with the
  sign for <b>Cimi</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h, i</i>, and
  A3 with the sign for <b>Tzec</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g,
  h</i>&mdash;and as far as Stela J is concerned it is not fixed in the
  Long Count. However, elsewhere at Quirigua this date is recorded in a
  Secondary Series, which is referred back to an Initial Series, and from
  this passage its corresponding Initial Series is found to be 9.15.6.14.6
  <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>. Reducing the number recorded in B1-A2, 18.3.14, to

  <p>But this was the Initial Series recorded on the reverse of this
  monument, consequently the Secondary-series dates, both of which have
  <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span>preceded the Initial-series date in point
  of time, bring this count up to the contemporaneous time of this
  monument, which was 9.16.5.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>. In view of the fact
  that the Secondary Series on Stela J are both earlier than the Initial
  Series, the chronological sequence of the several dates is better
  preserved by regarding the Initial Series as being at the close of the
  inscription instead of at the beginning, thus:</p>

</table>

  <p>By the above arrangement all the dates present in the text lead up to
  9.16.5.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 8 Zotz</b> as the most important date, because it
  alone records the particular hotun-ending which Stela J marks. The
  importance of this date over the others is further emphasized by the fact
  that it alone appears as an Initial Series.</p>

  <p>The text of Stela J illustrates two points in connection with
  Secondary Series which the student will do well to bear in mind: (1) The
  starting points of Secondary-series numbers do not always precede the
  numbers counted from them, and (2) the terminal dates and starting points
  are not always both recorded.</p>

  <p>The former point will be illustrated in the following example:</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>A</i>, is figured the Initial
  Series from the west side of Stela F at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_198"
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> The introducing glyph appears in
  A1-B2 and is followed by the Initial-series number in A3-A5. This is
  expressed by head variants and reads as follows: 9.14.13.4.17. The
  terminal date reached by this number is <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, which is
  recorded in B5-A6. The student will readily identify the numerals as
  above by comparing them with the forms in figures <a
  href="#fig51">51</a>-<a href="#fig53">53</a>, and the day and month signs
  by comparing them with figures <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a', b'</i>,
  and <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>, respectively. The Initial
  Series therefore reads 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>.<a
  name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Passing over B6-A10, the meanings of which are unknown, we reach in
  B10 the Secondary-series number 13.9.9. Reducing this to units of the
  first order, we have:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> B10b = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 13 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 360 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 4,680</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 4,869</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Assuming that our starting point is the date next preceding this
  number in the text, that is, the Initial-series terminal date <b>12 Caban
  5 Kayab</b> in B5-A6, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a
  href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), the terminal day reached will be
  <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>. This date the student will find recorded in plate
  <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>B</i>, B11b-A12a. Compare B11b with the
  sign for <b>Cimi</b> in figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h, i</i>, and
  A12a with the sign for <b>Tzec</b> in figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>,
  <i>g, h</i>. Moreover, since the Initial-series value of the starting
  point <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> is known, the Initial-series value of the
  terminal date <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b> may be calculated from it:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">13.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 4.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td> <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> </td></tr>

</table>

  <p>In A15 is recorded the date 3 <b>Ahau 3 Mol</b> (compare A15a with
  fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>k', i'</i>, and A15b with fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>m, n</i>) and in A17 the date <b>4 Ahau 13
  Yax</b> (compare A17a with fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>e'-g'</i> and
  A17b with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q, r</i>). This latter date,
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, is recorded elsewhere at Quirigua in a Secondary
  Series attached to an Initial Series, where it has the Initial-series
  value 9.15.0.0.0. This value we may assume, therefore, belongs to it in
  the present case, giving us the full date 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13
  Yax</b>. For the present let us pass over the first of these two dates,
  namely, <b>3 Ahau 3 Mol</b>, the Initial Series of which as well as the
  reason for its record here will better appear later.</p>

  <p>In B17-A18a is recorded another Secondary-series number composed of 3
  kins, 13 uinals, 16 tuns, and 1 katun, which we may write thus:
  1.16.13.3. The student will note that the katun coefficient in A18a is
  expressed by an unusual form, the thumb. As explained on page <a
  href="#page103">103</a>, this has a numerical value of 1. Again, our text
  presents another irregular feature. Instead of being counted either
  forward or backward from the date next preceding it in the text; that is,
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> in A17, this number is counted from the date
  following it in the text, like the two Secondary-series numbers in Stela
  J, just discussed. This starting date recorded in A18b B18a is <b>12
  Caban 5 Kayab</b>, which, as we have seen, is also the date recorded by
  the Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>A</i>, A1-A6.
  We are perfectly justified in <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page220"></a>{220}</span>assuming, therefore, that the <b>12 Caban
  5 Kayab</b> in A18b-B18a had the same Initial-series value as the <b>12
  Caban 5 Kayab</b> in plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>A</i>, B5-A6,
  namely, 9.14.13.4.17. Reducing the number in B17-A18a, namely, 1.16.13.3,
  to units of the first order, we have:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> A18a = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 1 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 7,200 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 7,200</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0"> B17b = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 16 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 360 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 5,760</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 13,223</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Remembering that this number is to be counted forward from the date
  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, and applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a
  href="#page139">139</a>, <a href="#page140">140</a>, and <a
  href="#page141">141</a>, respectively), the terminal date reached will be
  <b>1 Ahau 3 Zip</b>, which is recorded in A19. Compare the coefficient of
  the day sign in A19a with the coefficient of the katun sign in A18a, and
  the day sign itself with the profile variant for <b>Ahau</b> in figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h', i'</i>. For the month sign, compare A19b
  with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d</i>. But since the
  Initial-series value of the starting point is known, we may calculate
  from it the Initial-series value of the new terminal date:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">13.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 4.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17<span class="hid">]</span></td> <td> <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> </td></tr>

</table>

  <p>Passing over to the east side of this monument, the student will find
  recorded there the continuation of this inscription (see pl. <a
  href="#plate20">20</a>).<a name="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> This side, like the other, opens with
  an introducing glyph A1-B2, which is followed by an Initial Series in
  A3-A5. Although this number is expressed by head variants, the forms are
  all familiar, and the student will have little difficulty in reading it
  as 9.16.10.0.0. The terminal date which this number reaches is recorded
  in B5-B8; that is, <b>1<a name="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> Ahau 3 Zip</b>, the "month indicator"
  appearing as a head variant in A8 with the head-variant coefficient 10.
  But this date is identical with the date determined by calculation and
  actually recorded at the close of the inscription on the other side of
  this monument, and since no later date is recorded elsewhere in this
  text, we may conclude that 9.16.10.0.0 <b>1 Ahau 3 Zip</b> represents the
  contemporaneous time of Stela F, and hence that it was a regular
  hotun-marker. Here again, as in the case of Stela J at Quirigua, the
  importance of the "contemporaneous date" is emphasized not only by the
  fact that all the other dates lead up to it, but also by the fact that it
  is expressed as an Initial Series.</p>

  <p>We have explained all the dates figured except <b>3 Ahau 3 Mol</b> in
  plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>B</i>, A15, the discussion of which
  was deferred until after the rest of the inscription had been considered.
  It will be remembered in connection with Stela J (figs. <a
  href="#fig78">78</a>, <a href="#fig79">79</a>) that one of the dates
  reached in the course of the calculations was just 1 katun earlier than
  the date recorded by the Initial Series on the same monument. Now, one of
  the Initial-series values corresponding to the date <b>3 Ahau 3 Mol</b>
  here under discussion is 9.15.10.0.0, exactly 1 katun earlier than the
  Initial-series date on Stela F. In other words, if we give to the date
  <b>3 Ahau 3 Mol</b> in A15 the value 9.15.10.0.0, the cases are exactly
  parallel. While it is impossible to prove that this particular Initial
  Series was the one which the ancient scribes had in mind when they
  recorded this date <b>3 Ahau 3 Mol</b>, the writer believes that the
  coincidence and parallel here presented are sufficient to warrant the
  assumption that this is the case. The whole text reads as follows:</p>

  <p>The student will note the close similarity between this inscription
  and that on Stela J (figured in figs. <a href="#fig78">78</a> and <a
  href="#fig79">79</a>), a summary of which appears on page <a
  href="#page239">239</a>. Both commence with the same date, 9.14.13.4.17
  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>; both show the date 9.15.6.14.6 <b>6 Cimi 4
  Tzec</b>; both have dates which are just 1 katun in advance of the hotuns
  which they mark; and finally, both are hotun-markers, Stela J preceding
  Stela F by just 1 hotun. The date from which both proceed, 9.14.13.4.17
  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, is an important one at Quirigua, being the
  earliest date there. It appears on four monuments, namely, Stelæ J, F,
  and E, and Zoömorph G. Although the writer has not been able to prove the
  point, he is of the opinion that the glyph shown in figure <a
  href="#fig80">80</a>, <i>a</i>, tells the meaning of the event which
  happened on this date, which is, moreover, the earliest date at Quirigua
  which <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page222"></a>{222}</span>it is possible to regard as being
  contemporaneous. Hence, it is not improbable that it might refer to the
  founding of the city or some similar event, though this is of course a
  matter of speculation. The fact, however, that 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5
  Kayab</b> is the earliest date on four different hotun-markers shows that
  it was of supreme importance in the history of Quirigua. This concludes
  the discussion of texts showing the use of Secondary Series with Initial

  <p>It was explained in Chapter III (p. <a href="#page77">77</a>) that in
  addition to Initial-series dating and Secondary-series dating, the Maya
  used still another method in fixing events, which was designated
  Period-ending dating. It was explained further that, although
  Period-ending dating was less exact than the other two methods, it served
  equally well for all practical purposes, since dates fixed by it could
  not recur until after a lapse of more than 18,000 years, a considerably
  longer period than that covered by the recorded history of mankind.
  Finally, the student will recall that the katun was said to be the period
  most commonly used in this method of dating.</p>

  <p>The reason for this is near at hand. Practically all of the great
  southern cities rose, flourished, and fell within the period called Cycle
  9 of Maya chronology. There could have been no doubt throughout the
  southern area which particular cycle was meant when the "current cycle"
  was spoken of. After the date 9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b> had ushered
  in a new cycle there could be no change in the cycle coefficient until
  after a lapse of very nearly 400 (394.250 +) years. Consequently, after
  Cycle 9 had commenced many succeeding generations of men knew no other,
  and in time the term "current cycle" came to mean as much on a monument
  as "Cycle 9." Indeed, in Period-ending dating the Cycle 9 was taken for
  granted and scarcely ever recorded. The same practice obtains very
  generally to-day in regard to writing the current century, such
  expressions as July 4, '12, December 25, '13, being frequently seen in
  place of the full forms July 4, 1912, A.&nbsp;D., December 25, 1913, A.&nbsp;D.; or
  again, even more briefly, 7/4/12 and 12/25/13 to express the same dates,
  respectively. The desire for brevity, as has been explained, probably
  gave rise to Period-ending dating in the first place, and in this method
  the cycle was the first period to be eliminated as superfluous for all
  practical purposes. No one could have forgotten the number of the current
  cycle.</p>

  <p>When we come to the next lower period, however, the katun, we find a
  different state of affairs. The numbers belonging to this period were
  changing every 20 (exactly, 19.71 +) years; that is, three or four times
  in the lifetime of many individuals; hence, there was plenty of
  opportunity for confusion about the number of the katun in which a
  particular event occurred. Consequently, in order to insure accuracy the
  katun is almost always the unit used in Period-ending dating.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate21">21</a> are figured a number of
  Period-ending dates, the glyphs of which have been ranged in horizontal
  lines, and are numbered from left to right for convenience in reference.
  The true positions of these glyphs in the texts from which they have been
  taken are given in the footnotes in each case. In plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>A</i>, is figured a Period-ending date from
  Stela 2 at Copan.<a name="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>
  The date <b>12 Ahau 8 Ceh</b> appears very clearly in glyphs 1 and 2.
  Compare the month sign with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>u, v</i>.
  There follows in 3 a glyph the upper part of which probably represents
  the "ending sign" of this date. By comparing this form with the ending
  signs in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a> its resemblance to figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>o</i>, will be evident. Indeed, figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>o</i>, has precisely the same lower element as
  glyph 3. In glyph 4 follows the particular katun, 11, whose end fell on
  the date recorded in glyphs 1 and 2. The student can readily prove this
  for himself by reducing the Period-ending date here recorded to its
  corresponding Initial Series and counting the resulting number forward
  from the common starting point, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, as follows: Since
  the cycle glyph is not expressed, we may fill this omission as the Maya
  themselves filled it, by supplying Cycle 9. Moreover, since the
  <i>end</i> of a katun is recorded here, it is clear that all the lower
  periods&mdash;the tuns, uinals, and kins&mdash;will have to appear with
  the coefficient 0, as they are all brought to their respective ends with
  the ending of any katun. Therefore we may write the Initial-series number
  corresponding to the end of Katun 11, as 9.11.0.0.0. Treating this number
  as an Initial Series, that is, first reducing it to units of the first
  order, then deducting from it all the Calendar Rounds possible, and
  finally applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to
  the remainder, the student will find that the terminal date reached will
  be the same as the date recorded in glyphs 1 and 2, namely, <b>12 Ahau 8
  Ceh</b>. In other words, the Katun 11, which ended on the date <b>12 Ahau
  8 Ceh</b>, was 9.11.0.0.0 <b>12 Ahau 8 Ceh</b>, and both indicate exactly
  the same position in the Long Count. The next example (pl. <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>B</i>) is taken from the tablet in the Temple
  of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.<a name="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> In glyph 1 appears the date <b>8 Ahau
  8 Uo</b> (compare the month form with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>b,
  c</i>) and in glyph 3 the "ending" of Katun 13. The ending sign here is
  the variant shown in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>, and it
  occurs just above the coefficient 13. These two glyphs therefore record
  the fact that Katun 13 ended with the day <b>8 Ahau 8 Uo</b>. The student
  may again test the accuracy of the record by changing this Period-ending
  date to its <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page224"></a>{224}</span>corresponding Initial-series number,
  9.13.0.0.0, and performing the various operations indicated in such
  cases. The resulting Initial-series terminal date will be the same as the
  date recorded in glyphs 1 and 2, <b>8 Ahau 8 Uo</b>.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>C</i>, is figured a
  Period-ending date taken from Stela 23 at Naranjo.<a name="NtA_205"
  href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> The date <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>
  appears very clearly in glyphs 1 and 2 (compare the month form with fig.
  <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>a', b'</i>). Glyph 3 is the ending sign, here
  showing three common "ending elements," (1) the clasped hand; (2) the
  element with the curl infix; (3) the tassel-like postfix. Compare this
  form with the ending signs in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l-q</i>,
  and with the zero signs in figure <a href="#fig54">54</a>. In glyph 4 is
  recorded the particular katun, 14, which came to its end on the date
  recorded in 1 and 2. The element prefixed to the Katun 14 in glyph 4 is
  also an ending sign, though it always occurs as a prefix or superfix
  attached to the sign of the period whose close is recorded. Examples
  illustrating its use are shown in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>,
  <i>a-h</i>, with which the ending element in glyph 4 should be compared.
  The glyphs 1 to 4 in plate 21, <i>C</i>, therefore record that Katun 14
  came to an end on the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>. As we have seen above,
  this could be shown to correspond with the Initial Series 9.14.0.0.0 <b>6
  Ahau 13 Muan</b>.</p>

  <p>This same date, <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b> ending Katun 14, is also
  recorded on Stela 16 at Tikal (see pl. <a href="#plate21">21</a>,
  <i>D</i>).<a name="NtA_206" href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> The date
  itself appears in glyphs 1 and 2 and is followed in 3 by a sign which is
  almost exactly like the ending sign in glyph 3 just discussed (see pl. <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>C</i>). The subfixes are identical in both
  cases, and it is possible to distinguish the lines of the hand element in
  the weathered upper part of the glyph in 3. Compare glyph 3 with the
  ending signs in figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l-q</i>, and with the
  zero signs in figure <a href="#fig54">54</a>. As in the preceding
  example, glyph 4 shows the particular katun whose end is recorded
  here&mdash;Katun 14. The period glyph itself appears as a head variant to
  which is prefixed the same ending prefix or superfix shown with the
  period glyph in the preceding example. See also figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>. As above stated, the Initial Series
  corresponding to this date is 9.14.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>.</p>

  <p>One more example will suffice to illustrate the use of katun
  Period-ending dates. In plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>E</i>, is
  figured a Period-ending date from Stela 4 at Copan.<a name="NtA_207"
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> (compare the month in glyph 2 with fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q, r</i>), which is followed by the ending sign
  in 3. This is composed of the hand, a very common "ending" element (see
  fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>j, k</i>) with a grotesque head
  superfix, also another "ending sign" (see <i>i, r, u, v</i> of the plate
  just named). In glyph 4 follows the particular katun (Katun 15) whose
  <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span>end is here recorded. This date
  corresponds to the Initial Series 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>.</p>

  <p>Cases where tun endings are recorded are exceedingly rare. The bare
  statement that a certain tun, as Tun 10, for example, had come to its end
  left much to be desired in the way of accuracy, since there was a Tun 10
  in every katun, and consequently any given tun recurred after an interval
  of 20 years; in other words, there were three or four different Tun 10's
  to be distinguished from one another in the average lifetime. Indeed, to
  keep them apart at all it was necessary either to add the particular
  katun in which each fell or to add the date on which each closed. The
  former was a step away from the brevity which probably prompted the use
  of Period-ending dating in the first place, and the latter imposed too
  great a task on the memory, that is, keeping in mind the 60 or 70 various
  tun endings which the average lifetime included. For these reasons
  tun-ending dates occur but rarely, only when there was little or no doubt
  concerning the particular katun in which they fell.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>F</i>, is figured a tun-ending
  date from the tablet in the Temple of the Inscription at Palenque.<a
  name="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> In glyph 1 appears an
  ending sign showing the hand element and the grotesque flattened head
  (for the latter see fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>i, r, u, v</i>),
  both common ending signs. The remaining element, another grotesque head
  with a flaring postfix, is an unusual variant of the tun head found only
  at Palenque (see fig. <a href="#fig29">29</a>, <i>h</i>). The presence of
  the tun sign with these two ending signs indicates probably that some tun
  ending follows. Glyphs 2 and 3 record the date <b>5 Ahau 18 Tzec</b>, and
  glyph 4 records Tun 13. We have here then the record of a Tun 13, which
  ended on the date <b>5 Ahau 18 Tzec</b>. But which of the many Tun 13s in
  the Long Count was the one that ended on this particular date? To begin
  with, we are perfectly justified in assuming that this particular tun
  occurred somewhere in Cycle 9, but this assumption does not aid us
  greatly, since there were twenty different Tun 13s in Cycle 9, one for
  each of the twenty katuns. However, in the full text of the inscription
  from which this example is taken, <b>5 Ahau 3 Chen</b> is the date next
  preceding, and although the fact is not recorded, this latter date closed
  Katun 8 of Cycle 9. Moreover, shortly after the tun-ending date here
  under discussion, the date "<b>3 Ahau 3 Zotz</b>, end of Katun 9," is
  recorded. It seems likely, therefore, that this particular Tun 13, which
  ended on the date <b>5 Ahau 18 Tzec</b>, was 9.8.13.0.0 of the Long
  Count, after 9.8.0.0.0 but before 9.9.0.0.0. Reducing this number to
  units of the first order, and applying the several rules given for
  solving Initial Series, the terminal date of 9.8.13.0.0 will be found to
  agree with the terminal date recorded in glyphs 2 and 3, namely, <b>5
  Ahau 18 Tzec</b>, <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span>and this tun ending corresponded,
  therefore, to the Initial Series 9.8.13.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 18 Tzec</b>.</p>

  <p>Another tun-ending date from Stela 5 at Tikal is figured in plate 21,
  <i>G</i>.<a name="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> In glyphs
  1 and 2 the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin</b> appears, the month sign being
  represented as a head variant, which has the essential elements of the
  sign for Yaxkin (see fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k, l</i>).
  Following this in glyph 3 is Tun 13, to which is prefixed the same
  ending-sign variant as the prefixial or superfixial elements in figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>i, r, u, v</i>. We have recorded here then "Tun
  13 ending on <b>4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin</b>," though there seems to be no mention
  elsewhere in this inscription of the number of the katun in which this
  particular tun fell. By referring to Great Cycle 54 of Goodman's Tables
  (Goodman, 1897), however, it appears that Tun 13 of Katun 15 of Cycle 9
  closed with this date <b>4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin</b>, and we may assume,
  therefore, that this is the correct position in the Long Count of the
  tun-ending date here recorded. This date corresponds to the Initial
  Series 9.15.13.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 8 Yaxkin</b>.</p>

  <p>There is a very unusual Period-ending date on the west side of Stela C
  at Quirigua<a name="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> (see pl.
  <a href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>H</i>). In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the
  number 0 kins, 0 uinals, 5 tuns, and 17 katuns, which we may write
  17.5.0.0 and following this in glyphs 3 and 4 is the date <b>6 Ahau 13
  Kayab</b>. At first sight this would appear to be a Secondary Series, the
  number 17.5.0.0 being counted forward from some preceding date to reach
  the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b> recorded just after it. The next date
  preceding this on the west side of Stela C at Quirigua is the
  Initial-series terminal date <b>6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin</b>, illustrated
  together with its corresponding Initial-series number in figure <a
  href="#fig68">68</a>, <i>A</i>. However, all attempts to reach the date
  <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b> by counting either forward or backward the number
  17.5.0.0 from the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Yaxkin</b> will prove unsuccessful,
  and we must seek another explanation for the four glyphs here under
  discussion. If this were a Period-ending date it would mean that Tun 5 of
  Katun 17 came to an end on the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>. Let us see
  whether this is true. Assuming that our cycle coefficient is 9, as we
  have done in all the other Period-ending dates presented, we may express
  glyphs 1 and 2 as the following Initial-series number, provided they
  represent a period ending, not a Secondary-series number: 9.17.5.0.0.
  Reducing this number to units of the 1st order, and applying the rules
  previously given for solving Initial Series, the terminal date reached
  will be <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>, identical with the date recorded in
  glyphs 3 and 4. We may conclude, therefore, that this example records the
  fact that "Tun 5 of Katun 17 ended on the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>,"
  this being identical with the Initial Series 9.17.5.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13
  Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>The foregoing Period-ending dates have all been in Cycle 9, even
  though this fact has not been recorded in any of the above examples. We
  come next to the consideration of Period-ending dates which occurred in
  cycles other than Cycle 9.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>A</i>, is figured a
  Period-ending date from the tablet in the Temple of the Cross at
  Palenque.<a name="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> In glyphs
  1 and 2 appears the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> (compare the month form in
  glyph 2 with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g', h'</i>), and in glyph 3
  an ending sign (compare glyph 3 with the ending signs in fig. <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l-q</i>, and with the zero signs in fig. <a
  href="#fig54">54</a>). There follows in glyph 4, Cycle 13. These four
  glyphs record the fact, therefore, that Cycle 13 closed on the date <b>4
  Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting point of Maya chronology. This same date
  is again recorded on a round altar at Piedras Negras (see pl. <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>B</i>).<a name="NtA_212"
  href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> In glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, and in glyph 3a the ending sign, which is
  identical with the ending sign in the preceding example, both having the
  clasped hand, the subfix showing a curl infix, and the tassel-like
  postfix. Compare also figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>l-q</i>, and
  figure <a href="#fig54">54</a>. Glyph 3b clearly records Cycle 13. The
  dates in plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>A, B</i>, are therefore
  identical. In both cases the cycle is expressed by its normal form.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>C</i>, is figured a
  Period-ending date from the tablet in the Temple of the Foliated Cross at
  Palenque.<a name="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> In glyph 1
  appears an ending sign in which the hand element and tassel-like postfix
  show clearly. This is followed in glyph 2 by Cycle 2, the clasped hand on
  the head variant unmistakably indicating the cycle head. Finally, in
  glyphs 3 and 4 appears the date <b>2 Ahau 3 Uayeb</b> (compare the month
  form with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>i'</i>).<a name="NtA_214"
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> The glyphs in plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>C</i>, record, therefore, the fact that Cycle
  2 closed on the date <b>2 Ahau 3 Uayeb</b>, a fact which the student may
  prove for himself by converting this Period-ending date into its
  corresponding Initial Series and solving the same. Since the end of a
  cycle is recorded here, it is evident that the katun, tun, uinal, and kin
  coefficients must all be 0, and our Initial-series number will be,
  therefore, 2.0.0.0.0. Reducing this to units of the 1st order and
  proceeding as in the case of Initial Series, the terminal date reached
  will be <b>2 Ahau 3 Uayeb</b>, just as recorded in glyphs 3 and 4. The
  Initial Series corresponding to this Period-ending date will be 2.0.0.0.0
  <b>2 Ahau 3 Uayeb</b>.</p>

  <p>These three Period-ending dates (pl. <a href="#plate22">22</a>,
  <i>A-C</i>) are not to be considered as referring to times
  contemporaneous with the erection of the monuments upon which they are
  severally inscribed, since they <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page228"></a>{228}</span>precede the opening of Cycle 9, the first
  historic epoch of the Maya civilization, by periods ranging from 2,700 to
  3,500 years. As explained elsewhere, they probably referred to
  mythological events. There is a date, however, on a tablet in the Temple
  of the Cross at Palenque which falls in Cycle 8, being fixed therein by
  an adjoining Period-ending date that may have been historical. This case
  is figured in plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>G</i>.<a name="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> In glyphs 4 and 5 appears the date
  <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b> (compare the month form in glyph 5 with fig. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>u, v</i>). This is followed in glyph 6 by a sign
  which shows the same ending element as the forms in figure <a
  href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>i, r, u, v</i>, and this in turn is followed by
  Cycle 9 in glyph 7. The date recorded in this case is Cycle 9 ending on
  the date <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, which corresponds to the Initial Series
  9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>.</p>

  <p>Now, in glyphs 1 and 2 is recorded the date <b>2 Caban 10 Xul</b>
  (compare the day sign with fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a', b'</i>,
  and the month sign with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>i, j</i>), and
  following this date in glyph 3 is the number 3 kins, 6 uinals, or 6.3.
  This looks so much like a Secondary Series that we are justified in
  treating it as such until it proves to be otherwise. As the record
  stands, it seems probable that if we count this number 6.3 in glyph 3
  forward from the date <b>2 Caban 10 Xul</b> in glyphs 1 and 2, the
  terminal date reached will be the date recorded in glyphs 4 and 5; that
  is, the next date following the number. Reducing 6.3 to units of the
  first order, we have:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr0"> Glyph 3 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 6 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 20 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 120</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0"> Glyph 3 = </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 3 × </td><td class="ar pl025 pr0"> 1 = </td><td class="ar pl025"> 3</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> &mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><td class="ar pl025"> 123</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Counting this number forward from <b>2 Caban 10 Xul</b> according to
  the rules which apply in such cases, the terminal day reached will be
  <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, exactly the date which is recorded in glyphs 4 and
  5. But this latter date, we have just seen, is declared by the text to
  have closed Cycle 9, and therefore corresponded with the Initial Series
  9.0.0.0.0 <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>. Hence, from this known Initial Series we
  may calculate the Initial Series of the date <b>2 Caban 10 Xul</b> by

  <p>This latter date fell in Cycle 8, as its Initial Series indicates. It
  is quite possible, as stated above, that this date may have referred to
  some actual historic event in the annals of Palenque, or at least of <!--
  Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span>the
  southern Maya, though the monument upon which it is recorded probably
  dates from an epoch at least 200 years later.</p>

  <p>In a few cases Cycle-10 ending dates have been found. Some of these
  are surely "contemporaneous," that is, the monuments upon which they
  appear really date from Cycle 10, while others are as surely "prophetic,"
  that is, the monuments upon which they are found antedate Cycle 10.
  Examples of both kinds follow.</p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>E</i>, is figured a
  Period-ending date from Stela 8 at Copan.<a name="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> Glyphs 1 and 2 declare the date <b>7
  Ahau 18 ?</b>, the month sign in glyph 2 being effaced. In glyph 3 is
  recorded Cycle 10, the cycle sign being expressed by its corresponding
  head variant. Note the clasped hand, the essential characteristic of the
  cycle head. Above this appears the same ending sign as that shown in
  figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>, and it would seem probable,
  therefore, that these three glyphs record the end of Cycle 10. Let us
  test this by changing the Period-ending date in glyph 3 into its
  corresponding Initial-series number and then solving this for the
  resulting terminal date. Since the end of a cycle is here indicated, the
  katun, tun, uinal, and kin coefficients must be 0 and the Initial-series
  number will be, therefore, 10.0.0.0.0. Reducing this to units of the
  first order and applying the rules indicated in such cases, the resulting
  terminal date will be found to be <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>. But this agrees
  exactly with the date recorded in glyphs 1 and 2 so far as the latter go,
  and since the two agree so far as they go, we may conclude that glyphs
  1-3 in plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>E</i>, express "Cycle 10
  ending on the date <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>." Although this is a
  comparatively late date for Copan, the writer is inclined to believe that
  it was "contemporaneous" rather than "prophetic."</p>

  <p>The same can not be said, however, for the Cycle-10 ending date on
  Zoömorph G at Quirigua (see pl. <a href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>F</i>).
  Indeed, this date, as will appear below, is almost surely "prophetic" in
  character. Glyphs 1 and 2 record the date <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b> (compare
  the month form in glyph 2 with fig. <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d</i>)
  and glyph 3 shows very clearly "the end of Cycle 10." Compare the ending
  prefix in glyph 4 with the same element in fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>,
  <i>a-h</i>. Hence we have recorded here the fact that "Cycle 10 ended on
  the date <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>," a fact proved also by calculation in
  connection with the preceding example. Does this date represent,
  therefore, the contemporaneous time of Zoömorph G, the time at which it
  was erected, or at least dedicated? Before answering this question, let
  us consider the rest of the text from which this example is taken. The
  Initial Series on Zoömorph G at Quirigua has already been shown in figure
  <a href="#fig70">70</a>, and, according to page <a
  href="#page187">187</a>, it records the date 9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3
  Muan</b>. On the grounds of antecedent probability, we are justified in
  assuming at the outset that this date <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>therefore indicates the
  epoch or position of Zoömorph G in the Long Count, because it alone
  appears as an Initial Series. In the case of all the other monuments at
  Quirigua,<a name="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> where
  there is but one Initial Series in the inscription, that Initial Series
  marks the position of the monument in the Long Count. It seems likely,
  therefore, judging from the general practice at Quirigua, that
  9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Muan</b> was the contemporaneous date of Zoömorph
  G, not 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, that is, the Initial Series
  corresponding to the Period-ending date here under discussion (see pl. <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>F</i>).<a name="NtA_218"
  href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Other features of this text point to the same conclusion. In addition
  to the Initial Series on this monument there are upward of a dozen
  Secondary-series dates, all of which except <i>one</i> lead to
  9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Muan</b>. Moreover, this latter date is recorded
  thrice in the text, a fact which points to the conclusion that it was the
  contemporaneous date of this monument.</p>

  <p>There is still another, perhaps the strongest reason of all, for
  believing that Zoömorph G dates from 9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Muan</b>
  rather than from 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>. If assigned to the
  former date, every hotun from 9.15.15.0.0 <b>9 Ahau 18 Xul</b> to
  9.19.0.0.0 <b>9 Ahau 18 Mol</b> has its corresponding marker or
  period-stone at Quirigua, there being not a single break in the sequence
  of the fourteen monuments necessary to mark the thirteen hotun endings
  between these two dates. If, on the other hand, the date 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7
  Ahau 18 Zip</b> is assigned to this monument, the hotun ending
  9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Muan</b> is left without its corresponding
  monument at this city, as are also all the hotuns after 9.19.0.0.0 <b>9
  Ahau 18 Mol</b> up to 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, a total of four in
  all. The perfect sequence of the monuments at Quirigua developed by
  regarding Zoömorph G as dating from 9.17.15.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Muan</b>, and
  the very fragmentary sequence which arises if it is regarded as dating
  from 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, is of itself practically sufficient
  to prove that the former is the correct date, and when taken into
  consideration with the other points above mentioned leaves no room for
  doubt.</p>

  <p>If this is true, as the writer believes, the date "Cycle 10 ending on
  <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>" on Zoömorph G is "prophetic" in character, since it
  did not occur until nearly 45 years after the erection of the monument
  upon which it was recorded, at which time the city of Quirigua had
  probably been abandoned, or at least had lost her prestige.</p>

  <p>Another Cycle-10 ending date, which differs from the preceding in that
  it is almost surely contemporaneous, is that on Stela 11 at Seibal, <!--
  Page 231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>the
  latest of the great southern sites.<a name="NtA_219"
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> This is figured in plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, <i>D</i>. Glyphs 1 and 2 show very clearly the
  date <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, and glyph 3 declares this to be "at the end of
  Cycle 10."<a name="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> Compare
  the ending-sign superfix in glyph 3 with figure <a href="#fig37">37</a>,
  <i>a-h</i>. This glyph is followed by 1 katun in 4, which in turn is
  followed by the date <b>5 Ahau 3 Kayab</b> in 5 and 6. Finally, glyph 7
  declares "The end of Katun 1." Counting forward 1 katun from 10.0.0.0.0
  <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, the date reached will be <b>5 Ahau 3 Kayab</b>, as
  recorded by 5 and 6, and the Initial Series corresponding to this date
  will be 10.1.0.0.0 <b>5 Ahau 3 Kayab</b>, as declared by glyph 7. See
  below:</p>

  <p>This latter date is found also on Stelæ 8, 9, and 10, at the same
  city.</p>

  <p>Another Cycle-10 ending date which was probably "prophetic", like the
  one on Zoömorph G at Quirigua, is figured on Altar S at Copan (see fig.
  <a href="#fig81">81</a>). In the first glyph on the left appears an
  Initial-series introducing glyph; this is followed in glyphs 1-3 by the
  Initial-series number 9.15.0.0.0, which the student will find leads to
  the terminal date <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> recorded in glyph 4. This whole
  Initial Series reads, therefore, 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>. In
  glyph 6a is recorded 5 katuns and in glyph 7 the date <b>7 Ahau 18
  Zip</b>, in other words, a Secondary Series.<a name="NtA_221"

  <p>The "end of Cycle 10" in glyph 8a is merely redundancy. The writer
  believes that 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> indicates the present time
  of Altar S rather than 10.0.0.0.0 <b>7 Ahau 18 Zip</b>, and that
  consequently the latter date was "prophetic" in character, as was the
  same date on Zoömorph G at Quirigua. One reason which renders this
  probable is that the sculpture on Altar S very closely resembles the
  sculpture on Stelæ A and B at Copan, both of which date from 9.15.0.0.0
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>. A possible explanation of the record of Cycle 10 on
  this monument is the following: On the date of this monument, 9.15.0.0.0
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, just three-fourths of Cycle 9 had elapsed. This
  important fact would hardly have escaped the attention of the old
  astronomer-priests, and they may have used this monument to point out
  that only a quarter cycle, 5 katuns, was left in Cycle 9. This concludes
  the discussion of Cycle-10 Period-ending dates.</p>

  <p>The student will note in the preceding example (fig. <a
  href="#fig81">81</a>) that Initial-series, Secondary-series, and
  Period-ending dating have all been used together in the same text, glyphs
  1-4 recording an Initial-series date, glyphs 6a and 7, a Secondary-series
  date, and glyphs 7 and 8a, a Period-ending date. This practice is not at
  all unusual in the inscriptions and several texts illustrating it are
  figured below.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Initial Series, Secondary Series, and Period Endings</span></p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate23">23</a> is shown the inscription on Stela 3
  at Piedras Negras. The introducing glyph appears in A1 and is followed by
  the Initial-series number 9.12.2.0.16 in B1-B3. This number reduced to
  units of the first order and counted forward from its starting point will
  be found to reach the terminal date <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b>, which the
  student will readily recognize in A4-B7; the "month-sign indicator"
  appearing very clearly in A7, with the coefficient 9 affixed to it.
  Compare the day sign in A4 with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>z</i>,
  and the month sign in B7 with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k,
  l</i>. The Initial Series recorded in A1-A4, B7 reads, therefore,
  9.12.2.0.16 <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b>. In C1 D1 is recorded the number 0
  kins, 10 uinals, and 12 tuns; that is, 12.10.0, the first of several
  Secondary Series in this text. Reducing this to units of the first order
  and counting it forward from the terminal date of the Initial Series,
  <b>5 Cib 14 Yaxkin</b>, the terminal date of the Secondary Series will be
  found to be <b>1 Cib 14 Kankin</b>, which the student will find recorded

  calculated as follows:</p>

  <p>The fourth and last Secondary Series in this text follows in F6 and

  F9 is very clearly an ending sign; note the hand, tassel-like postfix,

  characteristic ending elements (see figs. <a href="#fig37">37</a>,

  <p>This shows that the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b> closed Katun 14, as
  glyphs F9-F10 declare. This may also be verified by changing "the end of
  Katun 14" recorded in F9-F10 into its corresponding Initial-series value,
  9.14.0.0.0, and solving for the terminal date. The day reached by these
  calculations will be <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>, as above. This text, in so

  <p>The inscription just deciphered is worthy of special note for several
  reasons. In the first place, all its dates and numbers are not only
  exceedingly clear, thus facilitating their identification, but also
  unusually regular, the numbers being counted forward from the dates next
  preceding them to reach the dates next following them in every case; all
  these features make this text particularly well adapted for study by the
  beginner. In the second place, this inscription shows the three principal
  methods employed by the Maya in recording dates, that is, Initial-series
  dating, Secondary-series dating, and Period-ending dating, all combined
  in the same text, the example of each one being, moreover, unusually
  good. Finally, the Initial Series of this inscription records identically
  the same date as Stela 1 at Piedras Negras, namely, 9.12.2.0.16 <b>5 Cib
  14 Yaxkin</b>. Compare plate <a href="#plate23">23</a> with plate <a
  href="#plate17">17</a>. Indeed, these two monuments, Stelæ 1 and 3, stand
  in front of the same building. All things considered, the inscription on
  Stela 3 at Piedras Negras is one of the most satisfactory texts that has
  been found in the whole Maya territory.</p>

  <p>Another example showing the use of these three methods of dating in
  one and the same text is the inscription on Stela E at Quirigua,
  illustrated in plate <a href="#plate24">24</a> and figure <a
  href="#fig82">82</a>.<a name="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> This text begins with the Initial
  Series on the west side. The introducing glyph appears in A1-B3 and is
  followed by the Initial-series number 9.14.13<a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>.4.17 in A4-A6. Reducing this number
  to units of the first order, remembering the correction in the tun
  coefficient in A5 noted below, and applying the rules previously given
  for solving Initial Series, the terminal date <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span>reached will be <b>12
  Caban 5 Kayab</b>. This the student will readily recognize in B6-B8b, the
  form in B8a being the "month sign indicator," here shown with a
  head-variant coefficient 10. Compare B6 with figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a', b'</i>, and B8b with figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d'-f'</i>. This Initial Series therefore should
  read as follows: 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>. Following down the
  text, there is reached in B10b-A11a, a Secondary-series number consisting
  of 3 kins, 13 uinals, and 6 tuns, that is, 6.13.3. Counting this number
  forward from the date next preceding it in the text, <b>12 Caban 5
  Kayab</b>, the date reached will be <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, which the
  student will find recorded in B11. Compare the month form in B11b with
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>q, r</i>. But since the Initial-series
  value of <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> is known, the Initial-series value of
  <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> may be calculated from it as follows:</p>

  <p>The next Secondary-series number appears in B12, plate <a
  href="#plate24">24</a>, <i>B</i>, and consists of 6 kins, 14 uinals, and
  1 tun, that is, 1.14.6.<a name="NtA_226"

  in A13b B13a, by counting forward 1.14.6 from <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> in
  B11, the date next preceding this number, will prove unsuccessful.
  However, by counting <i>backward</i> 1.14.6 from <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, he
  will find the date from which the count proceeds is <b>10 Ahau 8
  Chen</b>, though this latter date is nowhere recorded in this text. We
  have seen elsewhere, on Stela F for example (pl. <a
  href="#plate19">19</a>, <i>A, B</i>), that the date <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>
  corresponded to the Initial-series number 9.15.6.14.6; consequently, we
  may calculate the position of the unrecorded <!-- Page 237 --><span

  <p>We now see that there are 5 tuns, that is, 1 hotun, not recorded here,
  namely, the hotun from 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, to 9.15.5.0.0
  <b>10 Ahau 8 Chen</b>, and further, that the Secondary-series number
  1.14.6 in B12 is counted from the unexpressed date <b>10 Ahau 8 Chen</b>
  to reach the terminal date <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b> recorded in A13b
  B13a.</p>

  <p>The next Secondary-series number appears in A14b B14 and consists of
  15 kins, 16 uinals, 1 tun, and 1 katun, that is, 1.1.16.15. As in the
  preceding case, however, all efforts to reach the date following this
  number, <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> in A15b B15a, by counting it forward from
  <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, the date next preceding it in the text, will prove
  unavailing. As before, it is necessary to count it <i>backward</i> from
  <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> to determine the starting point. Performing this
  operation, the starting point will be found to be the date <b>7 Cimi 9
  Zotz</b>. Since neither of these two dates, <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> and
  <b>7 Cimi 9 Zotz</b>, occurs elsewhere at Quirigua, we must leave their
  corresponding Initial-series values indeterminate for the present.</p>

  <p>The last Secondary Series in this text is recorded in A17b B17a and
  consists of 19 kins,<a name="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>
  4 uinals, and 8 tuns. Reducing this number to units of the first order
  and counting it forward from the date next preceding it in the text,
  <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> in A15b B15a, the terminal date reached will be
  <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>, which the student will find recorded in A18.
  Compare the month sign with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>g',
  h'</i>. But immediately following this date in B18a is Katun 17 and in
  the upper part of B18b the hand-denoting ending. These glyphs A18 and B18
  would seem to indicate, therefore, that Katun 17 came to an end on the
  date <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>. That they do, may be proved beyond all
  doubt by changing this period ending into its corresponding
  Initial-series number 9.17.0.0.0 and solving for the terminal date. This
  will be found to be <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>, which is recorded in A18.
  This latter date, therefore, had the following position in the Long
  Count: 9.17.0.0.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>. But having determined the
  position of this latter date in the Long Count, that is, its
  Initial-series value, it is now possible to fix the positions of the two
  dates <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> and <b>7 Cimi 9 Zotz</b>, which we were
  obliged to leave indeterminate above. Since the date <b>13 Ahau 18
  Cumhu</b> was derived <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>by counting forward 8.4.19 from <b>11 Imix
  19 Muan</b>, the Initial-series value of the latter may be calculated by
  subtracting 8.4.19 from the Initial-series value of the former:</p>

  <p>And since the date <b>11 Imix 19 Muan</b> was reached by counting
  forward 1.1.16.15 from <b>7 Cimi 9 Zotz</b>, the Initial-series value of
  the latter may be calculated by subtracting 1.1.16.15 from the now known
  Initial-series value of the former:</p>

<table class="mc">

</table>

  <p>Although this latter date is not recorded in the text, the date next
  preceding the number 1.1.16.15 is <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, which
  corresponded to the Initial Series 9.15.6.14.6 <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, as
  we have seen, a date which was exactly 3 tuns earlier than <b>7 Cimi 9
  Zotz</b>, 9.15.9.14.6 <span class="nw">-</span> 9.15.6.14.6 = 3.0.0.</p>

  <p>The inscription on the west side closes then in A18 B18 with the
  record that Katun 17 ended on the date <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>. The
  inscription on the east side of this same monument opens with this same
  date expressed as an Initial Series, 9.17.0.0.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>.
  See figure <a href="#fig82">82</a>, A1-A6, A7,<a name="NtA_229"
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> and A10.</p>

  <p>The reiteration of this date as an Initial Series, when its position
  in the Long Count had been fixed unmistakably on the other side of the
  same monument by its record as a Period-ending date, together with the
  fact that it is the latest date recorded in this inscription, very
  clearly indicates that it alone designated the contemporaneous time of
  Stela E, and hence determines the fact that Stela E was a hotun-marker.
  This whole text, in so far as deciphered, reads as follows:</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that each one of these four monuments marks a
  different hotun in the Long Count, and consequently dates from a
  different period, all of them go back to the same date, 9.14.13.4.17
  <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, as their original starting point (see above).
  This date would almost certainly seem, therefore, to indicate some very
  important event in the annals of Quirigua. Moreover, since it is the
  earliest date found at this city which can reasonably be regarded as
  having occurred during the actual occupancy of the site, it is not
  improbable that it may represent, as explained elsewhere, the time at
  which Quirigua was founded.<a name="NtA_232"
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> It is necessary, however, to <!--
  Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>caution the student that the above
  explanation of the date 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, or indeed
  any other for that matter, is in the present state of our knowledge
  entirely a matter of conjecture.</p>

  <p>Passing on, it will be seen from Table <a href="#tableXVII">XVII</a>
  that two of the monuments, namely, Stelæ E and F, bear the date
  9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 3 Yax</b>, and two others, Stelæ E and J, the date
  9.15.5.0.0 <b>10 Ahau 8 Chen</b>, one hotun later. All four come together
  again, however, with the date 9.15.6.14.6 <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, which is
  recorded on each. This date, like 9.14.13.4.17 <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>,
  designates probably another important event in Quirigua history, the
  nature of which, however, again escapes us. After the date 9.15.6.14.6
  <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b>, these monuments show no further correspondences,
  and we may pass over the intervening time to their respective closing
  dates with but scant notice, with the exception of Zoömorph G, which
  records a half dozen dates in the hotun that it marks, 9.17.15.0.0 <b>5
  Ahau 3 Muan</b>. (These latter are omitted from Table <a
  href="#tableXVII">XVII</a>.)</p>

  <p>This concludes the presentation of Initial-series, Secondary-series,
  and Period-ending, dating, with which the student should be sufficiently
  familiar by this time to continue his researches independently.</p>

  <p>It was explained (see p. <a href="#page76">76</a>) that, when a
  Secondary-series date could not be referred ultimately to either an
  Initial-series date or a Period-ending date, its position in the Long
  Count could not be determined with certainty, and furthermore that such a
  date became merely one of the 18,980 dates of the Calendar Round and
  could be fixed only within a period of 52 years. A few examples of
  Calendar-round dating are given in figure <a href="#fig83">83</a> and
  plate <a href="#plate25">25</a>. In figure <a href="#fig83">83</a>, A, is
  shown a part of the inscription on Altar M at Quirigua.<a name="NtA_233"
  href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> In A1 B1 appears a number consisting
  of 0 kins, 2 uinals, and 3 tuns, that is, 3.2.0, and following this in
  A2b B2, the date <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, and in A3b B3 the date <b>6 Ahau

  <i>r</i>, and <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, respectively, of figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>. This has every appearance of being a Secondary
  Series, one of the two dates being the starting point of the number
  3.2.0, and the other its terminal date. Reducing 3.2.0 to units of the
  first order, we have:</p>

  <p>Counting this number forward from <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, the nearest
  date to it in the text, the terminal date reached will be found to be
  <b>6 Ahau 18 Zac</b>, the date which, we have seen, was recorded in A3b
  B3. It is clear, therefore, that this text records the fact that 3.2.0
  has been counted forward from the date <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> and the date
  <b>6 Ahau 18 Zac</b> has been reached, but there is nothing given by
  means of which the position of either of these dates in the Long Count
  can be determined; consequently either of these dates will be found
  recurring like any other Calendar-round date, at intervals of every 52
  years. In such cases the first assumption to be made is that one of the
  dates recorded the close of a hotun, or at least of a tun, in Cycle 9 of
  the Long Count. The reasons for this assumption are quite obvious.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming majority of Maya dates fall in Cycle 9, and nearly
  all inscriptions have at least one date which closed some hotun or tun of
  that cycle. Referring to Goodman's Tables, in which the tun endings of
  Cycle 9 are given, the student will find that the date <b>4 Ahau 13
  Yax</b> occurred as a tun ending in Cycle 9, at 9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13
  Yax</b>, in which position it closed not only a hotun but also a katun.
  Hence, it is probable, although the fact is not actually recorded, that
  the Initial-series value of the date <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> in this text is
  9.15.0.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b>, and if this is so the Initial-series
  value of the date <b>6 Ahau 18 Zac</b> will be:</p>

  <p>In the case of this particular text the Initial-series value
  9.15.0.0.0 might have been assigned to the date <b>4 Ahau 13 Yax</b> on
  the ground that this Initial-series value appears on two other monuments
  at Quirigua, namely, Stelæ E and F, with this same date.</p>

  <p>In figure <a href="#fig83">83</a>, <i>B</i>, is shown a part of the
  inscription from Altar Z at Copan.<a name="NtA_234"
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> In A1 B1 appears a number consisting
  of 1 kin, 8 uinals, and 1 tun, that is, 1.8.1, and following this in
  B2-A3 is the date <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>, but no record of its position
  in the Long Count. If <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b> is the terminal date of the
  number 1.8.1, the starting point can be calculated by counting this
  number backward, giving the date <b>12 Cauac 2 Zac</b>. On the other
  hand, if <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b> is the starting point, the terminal date
  reached by counting 1.8.1 forward will be <b>1 Imix 9 Mol</b>. However,
  since an ending prefix appears just before the date <b>13 Ahau 18
  Cumhu</b> in A2 (compare fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>a-h</i>), and
  since another, though it must be admitted a very unusual ending sign,
  appears just after this date in A3 (compare the prefix of B3 with the
  prefix of fig. <a href="#fig37">37</a>, <i>o</i>, and the subfix with the
  subfixes of <i>l-n</i> and <i>q</i> of the same figure), it seems
  probable that <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b> is the terminal date and also a
  Period-ending date. Referring to Goodman's Tables, it will be found that
  the only tun in Cycle 9 which ended with the date <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>
  was 9.17.0.0.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b>, which not only ended a hotun but
  a katun as well.<a name="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> If
  this is true, the unrecorded starting point <b>12 Cauac 2 Zac</b> can be
  shown to have the following Initial-series value:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">17.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0</td> <td> <b>13 Ahau 18 Cumhu</b></td></tr>

</table>

  <p>In each of the above examples, as we have seen, there was a date which
  ended one of the katuns of Cycle 9, although this fact was not recorded
  in connection with either. Because of this fact, however, we were able to
  date both of these monuments with a degree of probability amounting
  almost to certainty. In some texts the student will find that the dates
  recorded did not end any katun, hotun, or even tun, in Cycle 9, or in any
  other cycle, and consequently such dates can not be assigned to their
  proper positions in the Long Count by the above method.</p>

  <p>The inscription from Altar 5 at Tikal figured in plate <a
  href="#plate25">25</a> is a case in point. This text opens with the date
  <b>1 Muluc 2 Muan</b> in glyphs 1 and 2 (the first glyph or starting
  point is indicated by the star). <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>Compare glyph 1 with
  figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and glyph 2 with
  figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>a', b'</i>. In glyphs 8 and 9 appears
  a Secondary-series number consisting of 18 kins, 11 uinals, and 11 tuns
  (11.11.18). Reducing this number to units of the first order and counting
  it forward from the date next preceding it in the text, <b>1 Muluc 2
  Muan</b> in glyphs 1 and 2, the terminal date reached will be <b>13 Manik
  0 Xul</b>, which the student will find recorded in glyphs 10 and 11.
  Compare glyph 10 with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>j</i>, and glyph
  11 with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>i, j</i>. The next
  Secondary-series number appears in glyphs 22 and 23, and consists of 19
  kins, 9 uinals, and 8 tuns (8.9.19). Reducing this to units of the first
  order and counting forward from the date next preceding it in the text,
  <b>13 Manik 0 Xul</b> in glyphs 10 and 11, the terminal date reached will
  be <b>11 Cimi 19 Mac</b>, which the student will find recorded in glyphs
  24 and 25. Compare glyph 24 with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>h,
  i</i>, and glyph 25 with figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>w</i>,
  <i>x</i>. Although no number appears in glyph 26, there follows in glyphs
  27 and 28 the date <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b>, which the student will find
  is just three days later than <b>11 Cimi 19 Mac</b>, that is, one day
  <b>12 Manik 0 Kankin</b>, two days <b>13 Lamat 1 Kankin</b>, and three
  days <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b>.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that all these numbers are counted regularly from
  the dates next preceding them to reach the dates next following them,
  there is apparently no glyph in this text which will fix the position of
  any one of the above dates in the Long Count. Moreover, since none of the
  day parts show the day sign <b>Ahau</b>, it is evident that none of these
  dates can end any uinal, tun, katun, or cycle in the Long Count, hence
  their positions can not be determined by the method used in fixing the
  dates in figure <a href="#fig83">83</a>, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>

  <p>There is, however, another method by means of which Calendar-round
  dates may sometimes be referred to their proper positions in the Long
  Count. A monument which shows only Calendar-round dates may be associated
  with another monument or a building, the dates of which are fixed in the
  Long Count. In such cases the fixed dates usually will show the positions
  to which the Calendar-round dates are to be referred.</p>

  <p>Taking any one of the dates given on Altar 5 in plate <a
  href="#plate25">25</a>, as the last, <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b>, for
  example, the positions at which this date occurred in Cycle 9 may be
  determined from Goodman's Tables to be as follows:</p>

  <p>Next let us ascertain whether or not Altar 5 was associated with any
  other monument or building at Tikal, the date of which is fixed
  unmistakably in the Long Count. Says Mr. Teobert Maler, the discoverer of
  this monument:<a name="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> "A
  little to the north, fronting the north side of this second temple and
  very near it, is a masonry quadrangle once, no doubt, containing small
  chambers and having an entrance to the south. In the middle of this
  quadrangle stands Stela 16 in all its glory, still unharmed, <i>and in
  front of it, deeply buried in the earth, we found Circular Altar 5</i>,
  which was destined to become so widely renowned." It is evident from the
  foregoing that the altar we are considering here, called by Mr. Maler
  "Circular Altar 5," was found in connection with another monument at
  Tikal, namely, Stela 16. But the date on this latter monument has already
  been deciphered as "<b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b> ending Katun 14" (see pl. <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>D</i>; also p. <a href="#page224">224</a>),
  and this date, as we have seen, corresponded to the Initial Series
  9.14.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>.</p>

  <p>Our next step is to ascertain whether or not any of the Initial-series
  values determined above as belonging to the date <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b>
  on Altar 5 are near the Initial Series 9.14.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>,
  which is the Initial-series date corresponding to the Period-ending date
  on Stela <a href="#page16">16</a>. By comparing 9.14.0.0.0 with the
  Initial-series values of <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b> given above the student
  will find that the fifth value, 9.13.19.16.9, corresponds with a date
  <b>1 Muluc 2 Kankin</b>, which was only 31 days (1 uinal and 11 kins)
  earlier than 9.14.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Muan</b>. Consequently it may be
  concluded that 9.13.19.16.9 was the particular day <b>1 Muluc 2
  Kankin</b> which the ancient scribes had in mind when they engraved this
  text. From this known Initial-series value the Initial-series values of
  the other dates on Altar 5 may be obtained by calculation. The texts on
  Altar 5 and Stela 16 are given below to show their close connection:</p>

  <p>Sometimes, however, monuments showing Calendar-round dates stand <!--
  Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>alone, and in such cases it is almost
  impossible to fix their dates in the Long Count. At Yaxchilan in
  particular Calendar-round dating seems to have been extensively employed,
  and for this reason less progress has been made there than elsewhere in
  deciphering the inscriptions.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Errors in the Originals</span></p>

  <p>Before closing the presentation of the subject of the Maya
  inscriptions the writer has thought it best to insert a few texts which
  show actual errors in the originals, mistakes due to the carelessness or
  oversight of the ancient scribes.</p>

  <p><a name="fig84"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:49%;">
      <a href="images/fig84.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig84.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 84" title="Fig. 84" /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 84. Texts
    showing actual errors in the originals: <i>A</i>, Lintel, Yaxchilan;
    <i>B</i>, Altar Q, Copan; <i>C</i>, Stela 23, Naranjo.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Errors in the original texts may be divided into two general classes:
  (1) Those which are revealed by inspection, and (2) those which do not
  appear until after the indicated calculations have been made and the
  results fail to agree with the glyphs recorded.</p>

  <p>An example of the first class is illustrated in figure <a
  href="#fig84">84</a>, <i>A</i>. A very cursory inspection of this
  text&mdash;an Initial Series from a lintel at Yaxchilan&mdash;will show
  that the uinal coefficient in C1 represents an impossible condition from
  the Maya point of view. This glyph as it stands <!-- Page 246 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>unmistakably records 19
  uinals, a number which had no existence in the Maya system of numeration,
  since 19 uinals are always recorded as 1 tun and 1 uinal.<a
  name="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> Therefore the
  coefficient in C1 is incorrect on its face, a fact we have been able to
  determine before proceeding with the calculation indicated. If not 19,
  what then was the coefficient the ancient scribe should have engraved in
  its place? Fortunately the rest of this text is unusually clear, the
  Initial-series number 9.15.6.?.1 appearing in B1-D1, and the terminal
  date which it reaches, <b>7 Imix 19 Zip</b>, appearing in C2 D2. Compare
  C2 with figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>a, b</i>, and D2 with figure
  <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>d</i>. We know to begin with that the uinal
  coefficient must be one of the eighteen numerals 0 to 17, inclusive.
  Trying 0 first, the number will be 9.15.6.0.1, which the student will
  find leads to the date <b>7 Imix 4 Chen</b>. Our first trial, therefore,
  has proved unsuccessful, since the date recorded is <b>7 Imix 19 Zip</b>.
  The day parts agree, but the month parts are not the same. This month
  part <b>4 Chen</b> is useful, however, for one thing, it shows us how far
  distant we are from the month part <b>19 Zip</b>, which is recorded. It
  appears from Table <a href="#tableXV">XV</a> that in counting forward
  from position <b>4 Chen</b> just 260 days are required to reach position
  <b>19 Zip</b>. Consequently, our first trial number 9.15.6.0.1 falls
  short of the number necessary by just 260 days. But 260 days are equal to
  13 uinals; therefore we must increase 9.15.6.0.1 by 13 uinals. This gives
  us the number 9.15.6.13.1. Reducing this to units of the first order and
  solving for the terminal date, the date reached will be <b>7 Imix 19
  Zip</b>, which agrees with the date recorded, in C2 D2. We may conclude,
  therefore, that the uinal coefficient in C1 should have been 13, instead
  of 19 as recorded.</p>

  <p>Another error of the same kind&mdash;that is, one which may be
  detected by inspection&mdash;is shown in figure <a href="#fig84">84</a>,
  <i>B</i>. Passing over glyphs 1, 2, and 3, we reach in glyph 4 the date
  <b>5 Kan 13 Uo</b>. Compare the upper half of 4 with figure <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>f</i>, and the lower half with figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>b, c</i>. The coefficient of the month sign is
  very clearly 13, which represents an impossible condition when used to
  indicate the position of a day whose name is <b>Kan</b>; for, according
  to Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a>, the only positions which the day
  <b>Kan</b> can ever occupy in any division of the year are 2, 7, 12, and
  17. Hence, it is evident that we have detected an error in this text
  before proceeding with the calculations indicated. Let us endeavor to
  ascertain the coefficient which should have been used with the month sign
  in glyph 4 instead of the 13 actually recorded. These glyphs present
  seemingly a regular Secondary Series, the starting point being given in 1
  and 2, the number in 3, and the terminal date in 4. Counting this number
  3.4 forward from the starting point, <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>, the terminal
  date reached will be <b>5 Kan 12 Uo</b>. Comparing this with the terminal
  date actually recorded, we find that the two agree except for the month
  coefficient. But since the date recorded represents an impossible
  condition, as we <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page247"></a>{247}</span>have shown, we are justified in assuming
  that the month coefficient which should have been used in glyph 4 was 12,
  instead of 13. In other words, the craftsman to whom the sculpturing of
  this inscription was intrusted engraved here 3 dots instead of 2 dots,
  and 1 ornamental crescent, which, together with the 2 bars present, would
  have given the month coefficient determined by calculation, 12. An error
  of this kind might occur very easily and indeed in many cases may be
  apparent rather than real, being due to weathering rather than to a
  mistake in the original text.</p>

  <p>Some errors in the inscriptions, however, can not be detected by
  inspection, and develop only after the calculations indicated have been
  performed, and the results are found to disagree with the glyphs
  recorded. Errors of this kind constitute the second class mentioned
  above. A case in point is the Initial Series on the west side of Stela E
  at Quirigua, figured in plate <a href="#plate24">24</a>, <i>A</i>. In
  this text the Initial-series number recorded in A4-A6 is very clearly
  9.14.12.4.17, and the terminal date in B6-B8b is equally clearly <b>12
  Caban 5 Kayab</b>. Now, if this number 9.14.12.4.17 is reduced to units
  of the first order and is counted forward from the same starting point as
  practically all other Initial Series, the terminal date reached will be
  <b>3 Caban 10 Kayab</b>, not <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, as recorded.
  Moreover, if the same number is counted forward from the date <b>4 Ahau 8
  Zotz</b>, which may have been another starting point for Initial Series,
  as we have seen, the terminal date reached will be <b>3 Caban 10 Zip</b>,
  not <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b>, as recorded. The inference is obvious,
  therefore, that there is some error in this text, since the number
  recorded can not be made to reach the date recorded. An error of this
  kind is difficult to detect, because there is no indication in the text
  as to which glyph is the one at fault. The first assumption the writer
  makes in such cases is that the date is correct and that the error is in
  one of the period-glyph coefficients. Referring to Goodman's Table, it
  will be found that the date <b>12 Caban 5 Kayab</b> occurred at the
  following positions in Cycle 9 of the Long Count:</p>

</table>

  <p>An examination of these values will show that the sixth in the list,
  9.14.13.4.17, is very close to the number recorded in our text,
  9.14.12.4.17. Indeed, the only difference between the two is that the
  former has 13 tuns while the latter has only 12. The similarity between
  these two numbers is otherwise so close and the error in this <!-- Page
  248 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span>event
  would be so slight&mdash;the record of 2 dots and 1 ornamental crescent
  instead of 3 dots&mdash;that the conclusion is almost inevitable that the
  error here is in the tun coefficient, 12 having been recorded instead of
  13. In this particular case the Secondary Series and the Period-ending
  date, which follow the Initial-series number 9.14.12.4.17, prove that the
  above reading of 13 tuns for the 12 actually recorded is the one
  correction needed to rectify the error in this text.</p>

  <p>Another example indicating an error which can not be detected by
  inspection is shown in figure <a href="#fig84">84</a>, <i>C</i>. In
  glyphs 1 and 2 appears the date <b>8 Eznab 16 Uo</b> (compare glyph 1
  with fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>c'</i>, and glyph 2 with fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>b, c</i>). In glyph 3 follows a number
  consisting of 17 kins and 4 uinals (4.17). Finally, in glyphs 4 and 5 is
  recorded the date <b>2 Men 13 Yaxkin</b> (compare glyph 4 with fig. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>y</i>, and glyph 5 with fig. <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>k, l</i>). This has every appearance of being a
  Secondary Series, of which <b>8 Eznab 16 Uo</b> is the starting point,
  4.17, the number to be counted, and <b>2 Men 13 Yaxkin</b> the terminal
  date. Reducing 4.17 to units of the first order and counting it forward
  from the starting point indicated, the terminal date reached will be <b>1
  Men 13 Yaxkin</b>. This differs from the terminal date recorded in glyphs
  4 and 5 in having a day coefficient of 1 instead of 2. Since this
  involves but a very slight change in the original text, we are probably
  justified in assuming; that the day coefficient in glyph 4 should have
  been 1 instead of 2 as recorded.</p>

  <p>One more example will suffice to show the kind of errors usually
  encountered in the inscriptions. In plate <a href="#plate26">26</a> is
  figured the Initial Series from Stela N at Copan. The introducing glyph
  appears in A1 and is followed by the Initial-series number 9.16.10.0.0 in
  A2-A6, all the coefficients of which are unusually clear. Reducing this
  to units of the first order and solving for the terminal date, the date
  reached will be <b>1 Ahau 3 Zip</b>. This agrees with the terminal date
  recorded in A7-A15 except for the month coefficient, which is 8 in the
  text instead of 3, as determined by calculation. Assuming that the date
  recorded is correct and that the error is in the coefficient of the
  period glyphs the next step is to find the positions in Cycle 9 at which
  the date <b>1 Ahau 8 Zip occurred</b>. Referring to Goodman's Tables,
  these will be found to be:</p>

  <p>The number in the above list coming nearest to the number recorded in
  this text (9.16.10.0.0) is the next to the last, 9.16.4.17.0. But in
  order to reach this value of the date <b>1 Ahau 8 Zip</b> (9.16.4.17.0)
  with the number actually recorded, two considerable changes in it are
  first necessary, (1) replacing the 10 tuns in A4 by 4 tuns, that is,
  changing 2 bars to 4 dots, and (2) replacing 0 uinals in A5 by 17 uinals,
  that is, changing the 0 sign to 3 bars and 2 dots. But these changes
  involve a very considerable alteration of the original, and it seems
  highly improbable, therefore, that the date here <i>intended</i> was
  9.16.4.17.0 <b>1 Ahau 8 Zip</b>. Moreover, as any other number in the
  above list involves at least three changes of the number recorded in
  order to reach <b>1 Ahau 8 Zip</b>, we are forced to the conclusion that
  the error must be in the terminal date, not in one of the coefficients of
  the period glyphs. Let us therefore assume in our next trial that the
  Initial-series number is correct as it stands, and that the error lies
  somewhere in the terminal date. But the terminal date reached in counting
  9.16.10.0.0 forward in the Long Count will be <b>1 Ahau 3 Zip</b>, as we
  have seen on the preceding page, and this date differs from the terminal
  date recorded by 5&mdash;1 bar in the month coefficient. It would seem
  probable, therefore, that the bar to the left of the month sign in A15
  should have been omitted, in which case the text would correctly record
  the date 9.16.10.0.0 <b>1 Ahau 3 Zip</b>.</p>

  <p>The student will note that in all the examples above given the errors
  have been in the numerical coefficients, and not in the signs to which
  they are attached; in other words, that although the numerals are
  sometimes incorrectly recorded, the period, day, and month glyphs never
  are.</p>

  <p>Throughout the inscriptions, the exceptions to this rule are so very
  rare that the beginner is strongly advised to disregard them altogether,
  and to assume when he finds an incorrect text that the error is in one of
  the numerical coefficients. It should be remembered also in this
  connection that errors in the inscriptions are exceedingly rare, and a
  glyph must not be condemned as incorrect until every effort has been made
  to explain it in some other way.</p>

  <p>This concludes the presentation of texts from the inscriptions. The
  student will have noted in the foregoing examples, as was stated in
  Chapter II, that practically the only advances made looking toward the
  decipherment of the glyphs have been on the chronological side. It is now
  generally admitted that the relative ages<a name="NtA_238"
  href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> of most Maya monuments can be
  determined from the dates recorded upon them, and that the final date in
  almost every inscription indicates the time at or near which the monument
  bearing it was erected, or at least formally dedicated. The writer has
  endeavored to show, moreover, <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>that many, if indeed not most, of the
  monuments, were "time markers" or "period stones," in every way similar
  to the "period stones" which the northern Maya are known to<a
  name="NtA_239" href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> have erected at
  regularly recurring periods. That the period which was used as this
  chronological unit may have varied in different localities and at
  different epochs is not at all improbable. The northern Maya at the time
  of the Spanish Conquest erected a "period stone" every katun, while the
  evidence presented in the foregoing texts, particularly those from
  Quirigua and Copan, indicates that the chronological unit in these two
  cities at least was the hotun, or quarter-katun period. Whatever may have
  been the chronological unit used, the writer believes that the best
  explanation for the monuments found so abundantly in the Maya area is
  that they were "period stones," erected to commemorate or mark the close
  of successive periods.</p>

  <p>That we have succeeded in deciphering, up to the present time, only
  the calendric parts of the inscriptions, the chronological skeleton of
  Maya history as it were, stripped of the events which would vitalize it,
  should not discourage the student nor lead him to minimize the importance
  of that which is already gained. Thirty years ago the Maya inscriptions
  were a sealed book, yet to-day we read in the glyphic writing the rise
  and fall of the several cities in relation to one another, and follow the
  course of Maya development even though we can not yet fill in the
  accompanying background. Future researches, we may hope, will reconstruct
  this background from the undeciphered glyphs, and will reveal the events
  of Maya history which alone can give the corresponding chronology a human
  interest. <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">THE CODICES</p>

  <p>The present chapter will treat of the application of the material
  presented in Chapters III and IV to texts drawn from the codices, or
  hieroglyphic manuscripts; and since these deal in great part with the
  tonalamatl, or sacred year of 260 days, as we have seen (p. <a
  href="#page31">31</a>), this subject will be taken up first.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Tonalamatls</span></p>

  <p>The <i>tonalamatl</i>, or 260-day period, as represented in the
  codices is usually divided into five parts of 52 days each, although
  tonalamatls of four parts, each containing 65 days, and tonalamatls of
  ten parts, each containing 26 days, are not at all uncommon. These
  divisions are further subdivided, usually into unequal parts, all the
  divisions in one tonalamatl, however, having subdivisions of the same
  length.</p>

  <p>So far as its calendric side is concerned,<a name="NtA_240"
  href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> the tonalamatl may be considered as
  having three essential parts, as follows:</p>

  <p>1. A column of day signs.</p>

  <p>2. Red numbers, which are the coefficients of the day signs.</p>

  <p>3. Black numbers, which show the distances between the days designated
  by (1) and (2).</p>

  <p>The number of the day signs in (1), usually 4, 5, or 10, shows the
  number of parts into which the tonalamatl is divided. Every red number in
  (2) is used <i>once</i> with every day sign in (1) to designate a day
  which is reached in counting one of the black numbers in (3) forward from
  another of the days recorded by (1) and (2). The most important point for
  the student to grasp in studying the Maya tonalamatl is the fundamental
  difference between the use of the red numbers and the black numbers. The
  former are used only as day coefficients, and together with the day signs
  show the days which begin the divisions and subdivisions of the
  tonalamatl. The black numbers, on the other hand, are exclusively <i>time
  counters</i>, which show only the distances between the dates indicated
  by the day signs and their corresponding coefficients among the red
  numbers. They show in effect the lengths of the periods and subperiods
  into which the tonalamatl is divided. <!-- Page 252 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span></p>

  <p>Most of the numbers, that is (2) and (3), in the tonalamatl are
  presented in a horizontal row across the page or pages<a name="NtA_241"
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> of the manuscript, the red
  alternating with the black. In some instances, however, the numbers
  appear in a vertical column or pair of columns, though in this case also
  the same alternation in color is to be observed. More rarely the numbers
  are scattered over the page indiscriminately, seemingly without fixed
  order or arrangement.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed in each of the tonalamatls given in the following
  examples that the record is greatly abbreviated or skeletonized. In the
  first place, we see no month signs, and consequently the days recorded
  are not shown to have had any fixed positions in the year. Furthermore,
  since the year positions of the days are not fixed, any day could recur
  at intervals of every 260 days, or, in other words, any tonalamatl with
  the divisions peculiar to it could be used in endless repetition
  throughout time, commencing anew every 260 days, regardless of the
  positions of these days in succeeding years. Nor is this omission the
  only abbreviation noticed in the presentation of the tonalamatl. Although
  every tonalamatl contained 260 days, only the days commencing its
  divisions and subdivisions appear in the record; and even these are
  represented in an abbreviated form. For example, instead of repeating the
  numerical coefficients with each of the day signs in (1), the coefficient
  was written once above the column of day signs, and in this position was
  regarded as belonging to each of the different day signs in turn. It
  follows from this fact that all the main divisions of the tonalamatl
  begin with days the coefficients of which are the same. Concerning the
  beginning days of the subdivisions, a still greater abbreviation is to be
  noted. The day signs are not shown at all, and only their numerical
  coefficients appear in the record. The economy of space resulting from
  the above abbreviations in writing the days will appear very clearly in
  the texts to follow.</p>

  <p>In reading tonalamatls the first point to be determined is the name of
  the day with which the tonalamatl began. This will be found thus:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> To find the beginning day of a tonalamatl, prefix the
  first red number, which will usually be found immediately above the
  column of the day signs, to the uppermost<a name="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> day sign in the column.</p>

  <p>From this day as a starting point, the first black number in the text
  is to be counted forward; and <i>the coefficient</i> of the day reached
  will be the second red number in the text. As stated above, the <i>day
  signs</i> of the beginning days of the subdivisions are always omitted.
  From the second red number, which, as we have seen, is the <!-- Page 253
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>{253}</span>coefficient of
  the beginning day of the second <i>subdivision</i> of the first division,
  the <i>second black number</i> is to be counted forward in order to reach
  the third red number, which is the coefficient of the day beginning the
  <i>third subdivision</i> of the first division. This operation is
  continued until the last black number has been counted forward from the
  red number just preceding it and the last red number has been
  reached.</p>

  <p>This last red number will be found to be the same as the first red
  number, and the day which the count will have reached will be shown by
  the first red number (or the last, since the two are identical) used with
  the <i>second day sign</i> in the column. And this latter day will be the
  beginning day of the <i>second division</i> of the tonalamatl. From this
  day the count proceeds as before. The black numbers are added to the red
  numbers immediately preceding them in each case, until the last red
  number is reached, which, together with <i>the third day sign</i> in the
  column, forms the beginning day of <i>the third division</i> of the
  tonalamatl. After this operation has been repeated until the last red
  number in the last division of the tonalamatl has been reached&mdash;that
  is, the 260th day&mdash;the count will be found to have reentered itself,
  or in other words, the day reached by counting forward the last black
  number of the last division will be the same as the beginning day of the
  tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>It follows from the foregoing that the sum of all the black numbers
  multiplied by the number of day signs in the column&mdash;the number of
  main divisions in the tonalamatl&mdash;will equal exactly 260. If any
  tonalamatl fails to give 260 as the result of this test, it may be
  regarded as incorrect or irregular.</p>

  <p>The foregoing material may be reduced to the following:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> To find the coefficients of the beginning days of
  succeeding divisions and subdivisions of the tonalamatl, add the black
  numbers to the red numbers immediately preceding them in each case, and,
  after subtracting all the multiples of 13 possible, the resulting number
  will be the coefficient of the beginning day desired.</p>

  <p><i>Rule 3.</i> To find the day signs of the beginning days of the
  succeeding divisions and subdivisions of the tonalamatl, count forward in
  Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> the black number from the day sign of the
  beginning day of the preceding division or subdivision, and the day name
  reached in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> will be the day sign desired. If
  it is at the beginning of one of the <i>main divisions</i> of the
  tonalamatl, the day sign reached will be found to be recorded in the
  column of day signs, but if at the beginning of a <i>subdivision</i> it
  will be unexpressed.</p>

  <p>To these the test rule above given may be added:</p>

  <p><i>Rule 4.</i> The sum of all the black numbers multiplied by the
  number of day signs in the column of day signs will equal exactly 260 if
  the tonalamatl is perfectly regular and correct. <!-- Page 254 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span></p>

  <p>In plate <a href="#plate27">27</a> is figured page 12 of the Dresden
  Codex. It will be noted that this page is divided into three parts by red
  division lines; after the general practice these have been designated
  <i>a, b</i>, and <i>c, a</i> being applied to the upper part, <i>b</i> to
  the middle part, and <i>c</i> to the lower part. Thus "Dresden 12b"
  designates the middle part of page 12 of the Dresden Codex, and "Dresden
  15c" the lower part of page 15 of the same manuscript. Some of the pages
  of the codices are divided into four parts, or again, into two, and some
  are not divided at all. The same description applies in all cases, the
  parts being lettered from top to bottom in the same manner
  throughout.</p>

  <p>The first tonalamatl presented will be that shown in Dresden 12b (see
  the middle division in pl. <a href="#plate27">27</a>). The student will
  readily recognize the three essential parts mentioned on page <a
  href="#page251">251</a>: (1) The column of day signs, (2) the red
  numbers, and (3) the black numbers. Since there are five day signs in the
  column at the left of the page, it is evident that this tonalamatl has
  five main divisions. The first point to establish is the day with which
  this tonalamatl commenced. According to rule 1 (p. <a
  href="#page252">252</a>) this will be found by prefixing the first red
  number to the topmost day sign in the column. The first red number in
  Dresden 12b stands in the regular position (above the column of day
  signs), and is very clearly 1, that is, one red dot. A comparison of the
  topmost day sign in this column with the forms of the day signs in figure
  <a href="#fig17">17</a> will show that the day sign here recorded is
  <b>Ix</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>t</i>), and the opening
  day of this tonalamatl will be, therefore, <b>1 Ix</b>. The next step is
  to find the beginning days of the succeeding subdivisions of the first
  main division of the tonalamatl, which, as we have just seen, commenced
  with the day <b>1 Ix</b>. According to rule 2 (p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>), the first black number&mdash;in this case 13,
  just to the right of and slightly below the day sign <b>Ix</b>&mdash;is
  to be added to the red number immediately preceding it&mdash;in this case
  <b>1</b>&mdash;in order to give the coefficient of the day beginning the
  next subdivision, all 13s possible being first deducted from the
  resulting number. Furthermore, this coefficient will be the red number
  next following the black number.</p>

  <p>Applying this rule to the present case, we have:</p>

  <p>1 (first red number) + 13 (next black number) = 14. Deducting all the
  13s possible, we have left 1 (14 <span class="nw">-</span> 13) as the
  coefficient of the day beginning the next subdivision of the tonalamatl.
  This number 1 will be found as the red number immediately following the
  first black number, 13. To find the corresponding day sign, we must turn
  to rule 3 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) and count forward in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a> this same black number, 13, from the preceding day
  sign, in this case <b>Ix</b>. The day sign reached will be <b>Manik</b>.
  But since this day begins only a <i>subdivision</i> in this tonalamatl,
  not one of the <i>main divisions</i>, its day sign will not be recorded,
  and we have, therefore, the day <b>1 Manik</b>, of which the 1 is
  expressed by the second red number and the name part <b>Manik</b> only
  indicated by the calculations.</p>

<p><!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span></p>

  <p>The beginning day of the next subdivision of the tonalamatl may now be
  calculated from the day <b>1 Manik</b> by means of rules 2 and 3 (p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>). Before proceeding with the calculation incident
  to this step it will be necessary first to examine the next black number
  in our tonalamatl. This will be found to be composed of this sign (*<img
  src="images/glyph255a.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:5.64ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) to which 6 (1 bar and 1 dot) has been affixed. It was explained on
  page <a href="#page92">92</a> that in representing tonalamatls the Maya
  had to have a sign which by itself would signify the number 20, since
  numeration by position was impossible. This special character for the
  number 20 was given in figure <a href="#fig45">45</a>, and a comparison
  of it with the sign here under discussion will show that the two are
  identical. But in the present example the number 6 is attached to this
  sign thus: (**<img src="images/glyph255b.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:5.57ex;" alt="" title=""
  />), and the whole number is to be read 20 + 6 = 26. This number, as we
  have seen in Chapter IV, would ordinarily have been written thus
  (&dagger;<img src="images/glyph255c.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:5.93ex;" alt="" title=""
  />): 1 unit of the second order (20 units of the first order) + 6 units
  of the first order = 26. As explained on page <a href="#page92">92</a>,
  however, numeration by position&mdash;that is, columns of units&mdash;was
  impossible in the tonalamatls, in which many of the numbers appear in a
  horizontal row, consequently some character had to be devised which by
  itself would stand for the number 20.</p>

  <p>Returning to our text, we find that the "next black number" is 26 (20
  + 6), and this is to be added to the red number 1 next preceding it,
  which, as we have seen, is an abbreviation for the day <b>1 Manik</b>
  (see rule 2, p. <a href="#page253">253</a>). Adding 26 to 1 gives 27, and
  deducting all the 13s possible, namely, two, we have left 1 (27 <span
  class="nw">-</span> 26); this number 1, which is the coefficient of the
  beginning day of the next <i>subdivision</i>, will be found recorded just
  to the right of the black 26.</p>

  <p>The day sign corresponding to this coefficient 1 will be found by
  counting forward 26 in Table <a href="#tableI">I</a> from the day name
  <b>Manik</b>. This will give the day name <b>Ben</b>, and <b>1 Ben</b>
  will be, therefore, the beginning day of the next subdivision (the third
  subdivision of the first main division).</p>

  <p>The next black number in our text is 13, and proceeding as before,
  this is to be added to the red number next preceding it, 1, the
  abbreviation for <b>1 Ben</b>. Adding 13 to 1 we have 14, and deducting
  all the 23s possible, we obtain 1 again (14 <span class="nw">-</span>
  13), which is recorded just to the right of the black 13 (rule 2, p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>).<a name="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> Counting forward 13 in Table <a
  href="#tableI">I</a> from the day name <b>Ben</b>, the day name reached
  will be <b>Cimi</b>, and the day <b>1 Cimi</b> will be the beginning day
  of the next part of the tonalamatl. But since 13 is the last black
  number, we should have reached in <b>1 Cimi</b> the beginning day of the
  <i>second main division</i> of <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page256"></a>{256}</span>the tonalamatl (see p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>), and this is found to be the case, since the day
  sign <b>Cimi</b> is <i>the second</i> in the column of day signs to the
  left. Compare this form with figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>i, j</i>.
  The day recorded is therefore <b>1 Cimi</b>.</p>

  <p>The first division of the tonalamatl under discussion is subdivided,
  therefore, into three parts, the first part commencing with the day <b>1
  Ix</b>, containing 13 days; the second commencing with the day <b>1
  Manik</b>, containing 26 days; and the third commencing with the day <b>1
  Ben</b>, containing 13 days.</p>

  <p>The second division of the tonalamatl commences with the day <b>1
  Cimi</b>, as we have seen above, and adding to this the first black
  number, 13, as before, according to rules 2 and 3 (p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>), the beginning day of the next subdivision will
  be found to be <b>1 Cauac</b>. Of this, however, only the 1 is declared
  (see to the right of the black 13). Adding the next black number, 26, to
  this day, according to the above rules the beginning day of the next
  subdivision will be found to be <b>1 Chicchan</b>. Of this, however, the
  1 again is the only part declared. Adding the next and last black number,
  13, to this day, <b>1 Chicchan</b>, according to the rules just mentioned
  the beginning day of the next, or third, main division will be found to
  be <b>1 Eznab</b>. Compare the third day sign in the column of day signs
  with the form for <b>Eznab</b> in figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>z,
  a'</i>. The second division of this tonalamatl contains, therefore, three
  parts: The first, commencing with the day <b>1 Cimi</b>, containing 13
  days; the second, commencing with the day <b>1 Cauac</b>, containing 26
  days; and the third, commencing with the day <b>1 Chicchan</b>,
  containing 13 days.</p>

  <p>Similarly the third division, commencing with the day <b>1 Eznab</b>,
  could be shown to have three parts, of 13, 26, and 13 days each,
  commencing with the day <b>1 Eznab, 1 Chuen</b>, and <b>1 Caban</b>,
  respectively. It could be shown, also, that the fourth division commenced
  with the day <b>1 Oc</b> (compare the fourth sign in the column of day
  signs with figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>o</i>), and, further, that
  it had three subdivisions containing 13, 26, and 13 days each, commencing
  with the days <b>1 Oc, 1 Akbal</b>, and <b>1 Muluc</b>, respectively.
  Finally, the fifth and last division of the tonalamatl will commence with
  the day <b>1 Ik</b>. Compare the last day sign in the column of day signs
  with figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>c, d</i>; and its three
  subdivisions of 13, 26, and 13 days each with the days <b>1 Ik, 1
  Men</b>, and <b>1 Imix</b>, respectively. The student will note also that
  when the last black number, 13, has been added to the beginning day of
  the <i>last subdivision</i> of the <i>last division</i>, the day reached
  will be <b>1 Ix</b>, the day with which the tonalamatl commenced. This
  period is continuous, therefore, reentering itself immediately on its
  conclusion and commencing anew. <!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Next tonalamatl: 1st Division, 1st part, 13 days, beginning with the
  day <b>1 Ix</b>, etc.</p>

  <p>We may now apply rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) as a test to
  this tonalamatl. Multiplying the sum of all the black numbers, 13 + 26 +
  13 = 52, by the number of day signs in the column of day signs, 5, we
  obtain 260 (52 × 5), which proves that this tonalamatl is regular and
  correct.</p>

  <p>The student will note in the middle division of plate <a
  href="#plate27">27</a> that the pictures are so arranged that one picture
  stands under the first subdivisions of all the divisions, the second
  picture under the second subdivisions, and the third under the third
  subdivisions. It has been conjectured that these pictures represent the
  gods who were the patrons or guardians of the subdivisions of the
  tonalamatls, under which each appears. In the present case the first god
  pictured is the Death Deity, God A (see fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>). Note
  the fleshless lower jaw, the truncated nose, and the vertebræ. The second
  deity is unknown, but the third is again the Death God, having the same
  characteristics as the god in the first picture. The cloak worn by this
  deity in the third picture shows the crossbones, which would seem to have
  been an emblem of death among the Maya as among us. The glyphs above
  these pictures probably explain the nature of the periods to which they
  refer, or perhaps the ceremonies peculiar or appropriate to them. In many
  cases the name glyphs of the deities who appear below them are given; for
  example, in the present text, the second and sixth glyphs in the upper
  row<a name="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> record in each
  case the fact that the Death God is figured below.</p>

  <p>The glyphs above the pictures offer one of the most promising problems
  in the Maya field. It seems probable, as just explained, that the four or
  six glyphs which stand above each of the pictures in a tonalamatl tell
  the meaning of the picture to which they are appended, and any advances
  made, looking toward their deciphering, will lead to far-reaching results
  in the meaning of the <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>nonnumerical and noncalendric signs. In
  part at least they show the name glyphs of the gods above which they
  occur, and it seems not unlikely that the remaining glyphs may refer to
  the actions of the deities who are portrayed; that is, to the ceremonies
  in which they are engaged. More extended researches along this line,
  however, must be made before this question can be answered.</p>

  <p>The next tonalamatl to be examined is that shown in the lower division
  of plate <a href="#plate27">27</a>, Dresden 12c. At first sight this
  would appear to be another tonalamatl of five divisions, like the
  preceding one, but a closer examination reveals the fact that the last
  day sign in the column of day signs is like the first, and that
  consequently there are only four different signs denoting four divisions.
  The last, or fifth sign, like the last red number to which it
  corresponds, merely indicates that after the 260th day the tonalamatl
  reenters itself and commences anew.</p>

  <p>Prefixing the first red number, 13, to the first day sign,
  <b>Chuen</b> (see fig. <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>p, q</i>), according
  to rule 1 (p. <a href="#page252">252</a>), the beginning day of the
  tonalamatl will be found to be <b>13 Chuen</b>. Adding to this the first
  black number, 26, according to rules 2 and 3 (p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>), the beginning day of the next subdivision will
  be found to be <b>13 Caban</b>. Since this day begins only a subdivision
  of the tonalamatl, however, its name part <b>Caban</b> is omitted, and
  merely the coefficient 13 recorded. Commencing with the day <b>13
  Caban</b> and adding to it the next black number in the text, again 26,
  according to rules 2 and 3 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>), the beginning
  day of the next subdivision will be found to be <b>13 Akbal</b>,
  represented by its coefficient 13 only. Adding the last black number in
  the text, 13, to <b>13 Akbal</b>, according to the rules just mentioned,
  the beginning day of the next part of the tonalamatl will be found to be
  <b>13 Cib</b>. And since the black 13 which gave this new day is the last
  black number in the text, the new day <b>13 Cib</b> will be the beginning
  day of the next or <i>second division</i> of the tonalamatl, and it will
  be recorded as the second sign in the column of day signs. Compare the
  second day sign in the column of day signs with figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>v, w</i>.</p>

  <p>Following the above rules, the student will have no difficulty in
  working out the beginning days of the remaining divisions and
  subdivisions of this tonalamatl. These are given below, though the
  student is urged to work them out independently, using the following
  outline simply as a check on his work. Adding the last black number, 13,
  to the beginning day of the last subdivision of the last division, <b>13
  Eznab</b>, will bring the count back to the day <b>13 Chuen</b> with
  which the tonalamatl began: <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Next tonalamatl: 1st division, 1st part, 26 days, beginning with the
  day <b>13 Chuen</b>, etc.</p>

  <p>Applying the test rule to this tonalamatl (see rule 4, p. <a
  href="#page253">253</a>), we have: 26 + 26 + 13 = 65, the sum of the
  black numbers, and 4 the number of the day signs in the column of day
  signs,<a name="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> 65 × 4 = 260,
  the exact number of days in a tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>The next tonalamatl (see the upper part of pl. <a
  href="#plate27">27</a>, that is, Dresden 12a) occupies only the latter
  two-thirds of the upper division, the black 12 and red 11 being the last
  black and red numbers, respectively, of another tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>The presence of 10 day signs arranged in two parallel columns of five
  each would seem at first to indicate that this is a tonalamatl of 10
  divisions, but it develops from the calculations that instead there are
  recorded here two tonalamatls of five divisions each, the first column of
  day signs designating one tonalamatl and the second another quite
  distinct therefrom.</p>

  <p>The first red numeral is somewhat effaced, indeed all the red has
  disappeared and only the black outline of the glyph remains. Its
  position, however, above the column of day signs, seems to indicate its
  color and use, and we are reasonably safe in stating that the first of
  the two tonalamatls here recorded began with the day <b>8 Ahau</b>.
  Adding to this the first black number, 27, the beginning day of the next
  subdivision will be found to be <b>9 Manik</b>, neither the coefficient
  nor day sign of which appears in the text. Assuming that the calculation
  is correct, however, and adding the next black number, 25 (also out of
  place), to this day, <b>9 Manik</b>, the beginning day of the next part
  will be <b>8 Eb</b>. But since 25 is the last black number, <b>8 Eb</b>
  will be the beginning day of the next main division and should appear as
  the second sign in the first column of day signs. Comparison of this form
  with figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>r</i>, will show that <b>Eb</b>
  is recorded in this place. <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>In this manner all of the beginning days
  could be worked out as below:</p>

  <p>The application of rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) to this
  tonalamatl gives: 5 × 52 = 260, the exact number of days in a tonalamatl.
  As previously explained, the second column of day signs belongs to
  another tonalamatl, which, however, utilized the same red 8 as the first
  and the same black 27 and 25 as the first. The outline of this
  tonalamatl, which began with the day <b>8 Oc</b>, follows:</p>

  <p>The application of rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) to this
  tonalamatl gives: 5 × 52 = 260, the exact number of days in a tonalamatl.
  It is interesting to note that the above tonalamatl, beginning with the
  day <b>8 Oc</b>, commenced just 130 days later than the first tonalamatl,
  which began with the day <b>8 Ahau</b>. In other words, the first of the
  two tonalamatls in Dresden 12a was just half completed when the second
  one commenced, and the second half of the first tonalamatl began with the
  same day as the first half of the second tonalamatl, and vice versa.</p>

  <p>The tonalamatl in plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, upper division, is
  from Dresden 15a, and is interesting because it illustrates how certain
  missing parts may be filled in. The first red number is missing and we
  can only say that this tonalamatl began with some day <b>Ahau</b>.
  However, adding the first black number, 34, to this day <b>? Ahau</b>,
  the day reached will be <b>13 Ix</b>, of which only 13 is recorded. Since
  <b>13 Ix</b> was reached by counting 34 forward from the day with which
  the count must have started, by counting back 34 from <b>13 Ix</b> the
  starting point will be found to be <b>5 Ahau</b>, and we may supply a red
  bar above the column of the day signs. Adding the next black number, 18,
  to this day <b>13 Ix</b>, the beginning day of the next <i>division</i>
  will be found to be <b>5 Eb</b>, which appears as the second day sign in
  the column of day signs.</p>

  <p>Applying rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>), we have: 5 × 52 =
  260, the exact number of days in a tonalamatl. The next tonalamatl (see
  lower part of pl. <a href="#plate28">28</a>, that is, Dresden 15c) has 10
  day signs arranged in two parallel columns of 5 each. This, at its face
  value, would seem to be divided into 10 divisions, and the calculations
  confirm the results of the preliminary inspection.</p>

  <p>The tonalamatl opens with the day <b>3 Lamat</b>. Adding to this the
  first black number, 12, the day reached will be <b>2 Ahau</b>, of which
  only the 2 is recorded here. Adding to <b>2 Ahau</b> the next black
  number, 14, the day reached will be <b>3 Ix</b>. And since 14 is the last
  black number, this new day will be the beginning of the next division in
  the tonalamatl and will appear as the upper day sign in the second
  column.<a name="NtA_247" href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> Commencing

  glyph in the first column. This same operation if carried throughout will
  give the following outline of this tonalamatl:</p>

  <p>Applying rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) to this tonalamatl, we
  have: 5 × 52 = 260, the exact number of days in a tonalamatl. The last
  tonalamatl in plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, Tro-Cor., 102d, commences
  with the same day, <b>4 Ahau</b>, as the preceding tonalamatl and, like
  it, has five divisions, each of which begins with the same day as the
  corresponding division in the tonalamatl just given, <b>4 Ahau, 4 Eb, 4
  Kan, 4 Cib</b>, and <b>4 Lamat</b>. Tro-Cor. 102d differs from Tro-Cor.
  102c in the number and length of the parts into which its divisions are
  divided.</p>

  <p>Adding the first black number, 29, to the beginning day, <b>4
  Ahau</b>, the day reached will be <b>7 Muluc</b>, of which only the
  <b>7</b> appears in the text. Adding to this the next black number, 24,
  the day reached will be <b>5 Ben</b>. An examination of the text shows,
  however, that the day actually recorded is <b>4 Eb</b>, the last red
  number with the second day sign. This latter day is just the day before
  <b>5 Ben</b>, and since the sum of the black numbers in this case does
  not equal any factor of 260 (29 + 24 = 53), and since changing the last
  black number from 24 to 23 would make the sum of the black numbers equal
  to a factor of 260 (29 + 23 = 52), and would bring the count to <b>4
  Eb</b>, the day actually recorded, we are justified in assuming that
  there is an error in our original text, and that 23 should have been
  written here instead of 24. The outline of this tonalamatl, corrected as

  <p>Applying rule 4 (p. <a href="#page253">253</a>) to this tonalamatl, we
  have: 52 × 5 = 260, the exact number of days in a tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>The foregoing tonalamatls have been taken from the pages of the
  Dresden Codex or those of the Codex Tro-Cortesiano. Unfortunately, in the
  Codex Peresianus no complete tonalamatls remain, though one or two
  fragmentary ones have been noted.</p>

  <p>No matter how they are divided or with what days they begin, all
  tonalamatls seem to be composed of the same essentials:</p>

  <p>1. The calendric parts, made up, as we have seen on page <a
  href="#page251">251</a>, of (<i>a</i>) the column of day signs;
  (<i>b</i>) the red numbers; (<i>c</i>) the black numbers.</p>

  <p>2. The pictures of anthropomorphic figures and animals engaged in a
  variety of pursuits, and</p>

  <p>3. The groups of four or six glyphs above each of the pictures.</p>

  <p>The relation of these parts to the tonalamatl as a whole is
  practically determined. The first is the calendric background, the
  chronological framework, as it were, of the period. The second and third
  parts amplify this and give the special meaning and significance to the
  subdivisions. The pictures represent in all probability the deities who
  presided over the several subdivisions of the tonalamatls in which they
  appear, and the glyphs above them probably set forth their names, as well
  as the ceremonies connected with, or the prognostications for, the
  corresponding periods.</p>

  <p>It will be seen, therefore, that in its larger sense the meaning of
  the tonalamatl is no longer a sealed book, and while there remains a vast
  amount of detail yet to be worked out the foundation has been laid upon
  which future investigators may build with confidence.</p>

  <p>In closing this discussion of the tonalamatl it may not be out of
  place to mention here those whose names stand as pioneers in this
  particular field of glyphic research. To the investigations of Prof.
  Ernst Förstemann we owe the elucidation of the calendric part of the
  tonalamatl, and to Dr. Paul Schellhas the identification of the gods and
  their corresponding name glyphs in parts (2) and (3), above. As pointed
  out at the beginning of this chapter, the most promising <!-- Page 266
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>line of
  research in the codices is the groups of glyphs above the pictures, and
  from their decipherment will probably come the determination of the
  meaning of this interesting and unusual period.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Initial Series</span></p>

  <p>Initial Series in the codices are unusual and indeed have been found,
  up to the present time, in only one of the three known Maya manuscripts,
  namely, the Dresden Codex. As represented in this manuscript, they differ
  considerably from the Initial Series heretofore described, all of which
  have been drawn from the inscriptions. This difference, however, is
  confined to unessentials, and the system of counting and measuring time
  in the Initial Series from the inscriptions is identical with that in the
  Initial Series from the codices.</p>

  <p>The most conspicuous difference between the two is that in the codices
  the Initial Series are expressed by the second method, given on page <a
  href="#page129">129</a>, that is, numeration by position, while in the
  inscriptions, as we have seen, the period glyphs are used, that is, the
  first method, on page <a href="#page105">105</a>. Although this causes
  the two kinds of texts to appear very dissimilar, the difference is only
  superficial.</p>

  <p>Another difference the student will note is the absence from the
  codices of the so-called Initial-series "introducing glyph." In a few
  cases there seems to be a sign occupying the position of the introducing
  glyph, but its identification as the Initial-series "introducing glyph"
  is by no means sure, and, moreover, as stated above, it does not occur in
  all cases in which there are Initial Series.</p>

  <p>Another difference is the entire absence from the codices of
  Supplementary Series; this count seems to be confined exclusively to the
  monuments. Aside from these points the Initial Series from the two
  sources differ but little. All proceed from identically the same starting
  point, the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, and all have their terminal dates
  or related Secondary-series dates recorded immediately after them.</p>

  <p>The first example of an Initial Series from the codices will be found
  in plate <a href="#plate31">31</a> (Dresden 24), in the lower left-hand
  corner, in the second column to the right. The Initial-series number here
  recorded is 9.9.16.0.0, of which the zero in the 2d place (uinals) and
  the zero in the 1st place (kins) are expressed by red numbers. This use
  of red numbers in the last two places is due to the fact that the zero
  sign in the codices is <i>always red</i>.</p>

  <p>The student will note the absence of all period glyphs from this
  Initial Series and will observe that the multiplicands of the cycle,
  katun, tun, uinal, and kin are fixed by the positions of each of the
  corresponding multipliers. By referring to Table <a
  href="#tableXIV">XIV</a> the values of the several positions in the
  second method of writing the numbers will be found, and using these with
  their corresponding coefficients in each case the Initial-series number
  here recorded may be reduced to units of the 1st order, as follows:</p>

</table>

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 72 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), it may be reduced to zero, since 72
  Calendar Rounds contain exactly 1,366,560 units of the first order. See
  the preliminary rule on page <a href="#page143">143</a>.</p>

  <p>Applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>) to the
  remainder, that is, 0, the terminal date of the Initial Series will be
  found to be <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, exactly the same as the starting point
  of Maya chronology. This must be true, since counting forward 0 from the
  date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> will be
  reached. Instead of recording this date immediately below the last period
  of its Initial-series number, that is, the 0 kins, it was written below
  the number just to the left. The terminal date of the Initial Series we
  are discussing, therefore, is <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, and it is recorded
  just to the left of its usual position in the lower left-hand corner of
  plate 31. The coefficient of the day sign, 4, is effaced but the
  remaining parts of the date are perfectly clear. Compare the day sign
  <b>Ahau</b> with the corresponding form in figure <a
  href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>c', d'</i>, and the month sign <b>Cumhu</b> with
  the corresponding form in figure <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>z-b'</i>.
  The Initial Series here recorded is therefore 9.9.16.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 8
  Cumhu</b>. Just to the right of this Initial Series is another, the
  number part of which the student will readily read as follows:
  9.9.9.16.0. Treating this in the usual way, it may be reduced thus:</p>

</table>

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 71 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), it may be reduced to 16,780. Applying
  to this number rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively),
  its terminal date will be found to be <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>; this date
  is recorded just to the left below the kin place of the <i>preceding</i>
  Initial <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>{268}</span>Series. Compare the day sign and month
  sign of this date with figures <a href="#fig17">17</a>, <i>c', d'</i>,
  and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>x, y</i>, respectively. This second
  Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate31">31</a> therefore reads
  9.9.9.16.0 <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>. In connection with the first of these
  two Initial Series, 9.9.16.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, there is recorded a
  Secondary Series. This consists of 6 tuns, 2 uinals, and 0 kins (6.2.0)
  and is recorded just to the left of the first Initial Series from which
  it is counted, that is, in the left-hand column.</p>

  <p>It was explained on pages <a href="#page136">136</a>-<a
  href="#page137">137</a> that the almost universal direction of counting
  was forward, but that when the count was backward in the codices, this
  fact was indicated by a special sign or symbol, which gave to the number
  it modified the significance of "backward" or "minus." This sign is shown
  in figure <a href="#fig64">64</a>, and, as explained on page <a
  href="#page137">137</a>, it usually is attached only to the lowest
  period. Returning once more to our text, in plate <a
  href="#plate31">31</a> we see this "backward" sign&mdash;a red circle
  surmounted by a knot&mdash;surrounding the 0 kins of this
  Secondary-series number 6.2.0, and we are to conclude, therefore, that
  this number is to be counted backward from some date.</p>

  <p>Counting it backward from the date which stands nearest it in our
  text, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the date reached will be <b>1 Ahau 18
  Kayab</b>. But since the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> is stated in the text
  to have corresponded with the Initial-series value 9.9.16.0.0, by
  deducting 6.2.0 from this number we may work out the Initial-series value
  for this date as follows:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">16.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">0</td> <td> <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b></td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 6.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 2.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">0</td> <td> Backward</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">16.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">0</td> <td> <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b></td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The accuracy of this last calculation is established by the fact that
  the Initial-series value 9.9.9.16.0 is recorded as the second Initial
  Series on the page above described, and corresponds to the date <b>1 Ahau
  18 Kayab</b> as here.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to say why the terminal dates of these two Initial
  Series and this Secondary Series should have been recorded to the
  <i>left</i> of the numbers leading to them, and not just <i>below</i> the
  numbers in each case. The only explanation the writer can offer is that
  the ancient scribe wished to have the starting point of his
  Secondary-series number, <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, recorded as near that
  number as possible, that is, just below it, and consequently the Initial
  Series leading to this date had to stand to the right. This caused a
  displacement of the corresponding terminal date of his Secondary Series,
  <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>, which was written under the Initial Series
  9.9.16.0.0; and since the Initial-series value of <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>
  also appears to the right of 9.9.16.0.0 as 9.9.9.16.0, this causes a
  displacement in its terminal date likewise. <!-- Page 269 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>{269}</span></p>

  <p>Two other Initial Series will suffice to exemplify this kind of count
  in the codices. In plate <a href="#plate32">32</a> is figured page 62
  from the Dresden Codex. In the two right-hand columns appear two black
  numbers. The first of these reads quite clearly 8.16.15.16.1, which the
  student is perfectly justified in assuming is an Initial-series number
  consisting of 8 cycles, 16 katuns, 15 tuns, 16 uinals, and 1 kin.
  Moreover, above the 8 cycles is a glyph which bears considerable
  resemblance to the Initial-series introducing glyph (see fig. <a
  href="#fig24">24</a>, <i>f</i>). Note in particular the trinal superfix.
  At all events, whether it is an Initial Series or not, the first step in
  deciphering it will be to reduce this number to units of the first
  order:</p>

  this remainder, the terminal date reached will be <b>4 Imix 9 Mol</b>.
  This is not the terminal date recorded, however, nor is it the terminal
  date standing below the next Initial-series number to the right,
  8.16.14.15.4. It would seem then that there must be some mistake or
  unusual feature about this Initial Series.</p>

  <p>Immediately below the date which stands under the Initial-series
  number we are considering, 8.16.15.16.1, is another number consisting of
  1 tun, 4 uinals, and 16 kins (1.4.16). It is not improbable that this is
  a Secondary-series number connected in some way with our Initial Series.
  The red circle surmounted by a knot which surrounds the 16 kins of this
  Secondary-series number (1.4.16) indicates that the whole number is to be
  counted <i>backward</i> from some date. Ordinarily, the first Secondary
  Series in a text is to be counted from the terminal date of the Initial
  Series, which we have found by calculation (if not by record) to be <b>4
  Imix 9 Mol</b> in this case. Assuming that this is the case here, we
  might count 1.4.16 <i>backward</i> from the date <b>4 Imix 9 Mol</b>.</p>

  <p>Performing all the operations indicated in such cases, the terminal
  date reached will be found to be <b>3 Chicchan 18 Zip</b>; this is very
  close to the date which is actually recorded just above the
  Secondary-series number and just below the Initial-series number. The
  date here recorded is <b>3 Chicchan 13 Zip</b>, and it is not improbable
  that the <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>ancient scribe intended to write instead
  <b>3 Chicchan 18 Zip</b>, the date indicated by the calculations. We
  probably have here:</p>

  <p>In these calculations the terminal date of the Initial Series, <b>4

  18 Zip</b>, the terminal date of the Secondary Series.</p>

  <p>Another Initial Series of this same kind, one in which the terminal
  date is not recorded, is shown just to the right of the preceding in
  plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>. The Initial-series number 8.16.14.15.4
  there recorded reduces to units of the first order as follows:</p>

<table class="mc">

</table>

  <p>Deducting from this number all the Calendar Rounds possible, 67 (see
  Table <a href="#tableXVI">XVI</a>), it will be reduced to 884, and
  applying rules 1, 2, and 3 (pp. <a href="#page139">139</a>, <a
  href="#page140">140</a>, and <a href="#page141">141</a>, respectively) to
  this remainder, the terminal date reached will be <b>4 Kan 17 Yaxkin</b>.
  This date is not recorded. There follows below, however, a
  Secondary-series number consisting of 6 uinals and 1 kin (6.1). The red
  circle around the lower term of this (the 1 kin) indicates that the whole
  number, 6.1, is to be counted <i>backward</i> from some date, probably,
  as in the preceding case, from the terminal date of the Initial Series
  above it. Assuming that this is the case, and counting 6.1 backward from
  8.16.14.15.4 <b>4 Kan 17 Yaxkin</b>, the terminal date reached will be
  <b>13 Akbal 16 Pop</b>, again very close to the date recorded immediately
  above, <b>13 Akbal 15 Pop</b>. Indeed, the date as recorded, <b>13 Akbal
  15 Pop</b>, represents an impossible condition from the Maya point of
  view, since the day name <b>Akbal</b> could occupy only the first, sixth,
  eleventh, and sixteenth positions of a month. See Table <a
  href="#tableVII">VII</a>. Consequently, through lack of space or
  carelessness the ancient scribe who painted this book failed to add one
  dot to the three bars of the month sign's coefficient, thus making it 16
  instead of the 15 actually recorded. We are obliged to make some
  correction in this coefficient, since, as explained above, it is
  obviously incorrect as it stands. Since the addition of a single dot
  brings the whole date into harmony with the date determined by
  calculation, we are probably justified <!-- Page 271 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>{271}</span>in making the
  correction here suggested. We have recorded here therefore:</p>

  <p>The above will suffice to show the use of Initial Series in the

  <p>There is a wide range of time covered by these Initial Series; indeed,
  from the earliest 8.6.16.12.0 (on p. 70) to the latest, 10.19.6.1.8 (on
  p. 51) there elapsed more than a thousand years. Where the difference
  between the earliest and the latest dates is so great, it is a matter of
  vital importance to determine the contemporaneous date of the manuscript.
  If the closing date 10.19.6.1.8 represents the time at which the
  manuscript was made, then the preceding dates reach back <!-- Page 272
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>{272}</span>for more than
  a thousand years. On the other hand, if 8.6.16.12.0 records the present
  time of the manuscript, then all the following dates are prophetic. It is
  a difficult question to answer, and the best authorities have seemed
  disposed to take a middle course, assigning as the contemporaneous date
  of the codex a date about the middle of Cycle 9. Says Professor
  Förstemann (<i>Bulletin 28</i>, p. 402) on the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>In my opinion my demonstration also definitely proves that these large
  numbers [the Initial Series] do not proceed from the future to the past,
  but from the past, through the present, to the future. Unless I am quite
  mistaken, the highest numbers among them seem actually to reach into the
  future, and thus to have a prophetic meaning. Here the question arises,
  At what point in this series of numbers does the present lie? or, Has the
  writer in different portions of his work adopted different points of time
  as the present? If I may venture to express my conjecture, it seems to me
  that the first large number in the whole manuscript, the 1,366,560 in the
  second column of page 24 [9.9.16.0.0 <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the first
  Initial Series figured in plate 31], has the greatest claim to be
  interpreted as the present point of time.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a later article (<i>Bulletin 28</i>, p. 437) Professor Förstemann
  says: "But I think it is more probable that the date farthest to the
  right (1 Ahau, 18 Zip ...) denotes the present, the other two [namely,
  9.9.16.0.0 4 <b>Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> and 9.9.9.16.0 <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>]
  alluding to remarkable days in the future." He assigns to this date <b>1
  Ahau 18 Zip</b> the position of 9.7.16.12.0 in the Long Count.</p>

  <p>The writer believes this theory to be untenable because it involves a
  correction in the original text. The date which Professor Förstemann
  calls <b>1 Ahau 18 Zip</b> actually reads <b>1 Ahau 18 Uo</b>, as he
  himself admits. The month sign he corrects to <b>Zip</b> in spite of the
  fact that it is very clearly <b>Uo</b>. Compare this form with figure <a
  href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>b, c</i>. The date <b>1 Ahau 18 Uo</b> occurs at
  9.8.16.16.0, but the writer sees no reason for believing that this date
  or the reading suggested by Professor Förstemann indicates the
  contemporaneous time of this manuscript.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bowditch assigns the manuscript to approximately the same period,
  selecting the second Initial Series in plate <a href="#plate31">31</a>,
  that is, 9.9.9.16.0 <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>: "My opinion is that the date
  9.9.9.16.0 <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b> is the present time with reference to
  the time of writing the codex and is the date from which the whole
  calculation starts."<a name="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>
  The reasons which have led Mr. Bowditch to this conclusion are very
  convincing and will make for the general acceptance of his
  hypothesis.</p>

  <p>Although the writer has no better suggestion to offer at the present
  time, he is inclined to believe that both of these dates are far too
  early for this manuscript and that it is to be ascribed to a very much
  later period, perhaps to the centuries following immediately the
  colonization of Yucatan. There can be no doubt that very early dates
  appear in the Dresden Codex, but rather than accept one so early as
  9.9.9.16.0 or 9.9.16.0.0 as the contemporaneous date of the manuscript
  the writer would prefer to believe, on historical grounds, that the
  manuscript now known as the Dresden Codex is a copy of an earlier
  manuscript and that the present copy dates from the later Maya period in
  Yucatan, though sometime before either Nahuatl or Castilian acculturation
  had begun.</p>

  <p>The Dresden Codex contains another class of numbers which, so far as
  known, occur nowhere else. These have been called the Serpent numbers
  because their various orders of units are depicted between the coils of
  serpents. Two of these serpents appear in plate <a
  href="#plate32">32</a>. The coils of each serpent inclose two different
  numbers, one in red and the other in black. Every one of the Serpent
  numbers has six terms, and they represent by far the highest numbers to
  be found in the codices. The black number in the first, or left-hand
  serpent in plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>, reads as follows:
  4.6.7.12.4.10, which, reduced to units of the first order, reads:</p>

  <p>The next question which arises is, What is the starting point from
  which this number is counted? Just below it the student will note the
  date <b>3 Ix 7 Tzec</b>, which from its position would seem almost surely
  to be either the starting point or the terminal date, more probably the
  latter. Assuming that this date is the terminal date, the starting point
  may be calculated by counting 12,438,810 <i>backward</i> from <b>3 Ix 7
  Tzec</b>. Performing this operation according to the rules laid down in
  such cases, the starting point reached will be <b>9 Kan 12 Xul</b>, but
  this date is not found in the text.</p>

    first method of numeration in the codices (part of page 69 of the
    Dresden Codex).</p>
  </div>

  <p>It will be seen from the foregoing that three of the four Serpent
  dates above described are counted from the date <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, a
  date actually recorded in the text just above them. The all-important
  question of course is, What position did the date <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>
  occupy in the Long Count? The page (62) of the Dresden Codex we <!-- Page
  275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>{275}</span>are
  discussing sheds no light on this question. There are, however, two other
  pages in this Codex (61 and 69) on which Serpent numbers appear
  presenting this date, <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, under conditions which may
  shed light on the position it held in the Long Count. On page 69 there
  are recorded 15 katuns, 9 tuns, 4 uinals, and 4 kins (see fig. <a
  href="#fig85">85</a>); these are immediately followed by the date <b>9
  Kan 12 Kayab</b>. It is important to note in this connection that, unlike
  almost every other number in this codex, this number is expressed by the
  first method, the one in which the period glyphs are used. As the date
  <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> appears just above in the text, the first
  supposition is that 15.9.4.4 is a Secondary-series number which, if
  counted forward from <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the starting point of Maya
  chronology, will reach <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, the date recorded
  immediately after it. Proceeding on this assumption and performing the
  operations indicated, the terminal date reached will be <b>9 Kan 7
  Cumhu</b>, not <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, as recorded. The most plausible
  explanation for this number and date the writer can offer is that the
  whole constitutes a Period-ending date. On the west side of Stela C at
  Quirigua, as explained on page <a href="#page226">226</a>, is a
  Period-ending date almost exactly like this (see pl. <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, <i>H</i>). On this monument 17.5.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13
  Kayab</b> is recorded, and it was proved by calculation that 9.17.5.0.0
  would lead to this date if counted forward from the starting point of
  Maya chronology. In effect, then, this 17.5.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>
  was a Period-ending date, declaring that Tun 5 of Katun 17 (of Cycle 9,
  unexpressed) ended on the date <b>6 Ahau 13 Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>Interpreting in the same way the glyphs in figure <a
  href="#fig85">85</a>, we have the record that Kin 4 of Uinal 4 of Tun 9
  of Katun 15 (of Cycle 9, unexpressed) fell (or ended) on the date <b>9
  Kan 12 Kayab</b>. Changing this Period-ending date into its corresponding
  Initial Series and solving for its terminal date, the latter date will be
  found to be <b>13 Kan 12 Ceh</b>, instead of <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>. At
  first this would appear to be even farther from the mark than our
  preceding attempt, but if the reader will admit a slight correction, the
  above number can be made to reach the date recorded. The date <b>13 Kan
  12 Ceh</b> is just 5 uinals earlier than <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, and if we
  add one bar to the four dots of the uinal coefficient, this passage can
  be explained in the above manner, and yet agree in all particulars. This
  is true since 9.15.9.9.4 reaches the date <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>. On the
  above grounds the writer is inclined to believe that the last three
  Serpent numbers on plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>, which were shown to
  have proceeded from a date <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>, were counted from the
  date 9.15.9.9.4 <b>9 Kan 12 Kayab</b>. <!-- Page 276 --><span

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">Texts Recording Ascending Series</span></p>

  <p>There remains one other class of numbers which should be described
  before closing this chapter on the codices. The writer refers to the
  series of related numbers which cover so many pages of the Dresden Codex.
  These commence at the bottom of the page and increase toward the top,
  every other number in the series being a multiple of the first, or
  beginning number. One example of this class will suffice to illustrate
  all the others.</p>

  <p>In the lower right-hand corner of plate <a href="#plate31">31</a> a
  series of this kind commences with the day <b>9 Ahau</b>.<a
  name="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> Of this series the
  number 8.2.0 just above the <b>9 Ahau</b> is the first term, and the day
  <b>9 Ahau</b> the first terminal date. As usual in Maya texts, the
  starting point is not expressed; by calculation, however, it can be shown
  to be <b>1 Ahau</b><a name="NtA_265" href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>
  in this particular case.</p>

  <p>Counting forward then 8.2.0 from <b>1 Ahau</b>, the unexpressed
  starting point, the first terminal date, <b>9 Ahau</b>, will be reached.
  See the lower right-hand corner in the following outline, in which the
  Maya numbers have all been reduced to units of the first order:</p>

  <p>In the above outline each number represents the total distance of the
  day just below it from the unexpressed starting point, <b>1 Ahau</b>,
  <i>not</i> the distance from the date immediately preceding it in the
  series. For example, the second number, 5,840 (16.4.0), is not to be
  counted forward from <b>9 Ahau</b> in order to reach its terminal date,
  <b>4 Ahau</b>, but from the unexpressed starting point of the whole
  series, the day <b>1 Ahau</b>. Similarly the third number, 8,760
  (1.4.6.0), is not to be counted forward from <b>4 Ahau</b> in order to
  reach <b>12 Ahau</b>, but from <b>1 Ahau</b> instead, and so on
  throughout the series. <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Beginning with the number 2,920 and the starting point <b>1 Ahau</b>,
  the first twelve terms, that is, the numbers in the three lowest rows,
  are the first 12 multiples of 2,920.</p>

  <p>The days recorded under each of these numbers, as mentioned above, are
  the terminal dates of these distances from the starting point, <b>1
  Ahau</b>. Passing over the fourth row from the bottom, which, as will
  appear presently, is probably an interpolation of some kind, the
  thirteenth number&mdash;that is, the right-hand one in the top
  row&mdash;is 37,960. But 37,960 is 13 × 2,920, a continuation of our
  series the twelfth term of which appeared in the left-hand number of the
  third row. Under the thirteenth number is set down the day <b>1 Ahau</b>;
  in other words, not until the thirteenth multiple of 2,920 is reached is
  the terminal day the same as the starting point.</p>

  <p>With this thirteenth term 2,920 ceases to be the unit of increase, and
  the thirteenth term itself (37,960) is used as a difference to reach the
  remaining three terms on this top line, all of which are multiples of
  37,960.</p>

  <p>Counting forward each one of these from the starting point of this
  entire series, <b>1 Ahau</b>, each will be found to reach as its terminal
  day <b>1 Ahau</b>, as recorded under each. The fourth line from the
  bottom is more difficult to understand, and the explanation offered by
  Professor Förstemann, that the first and third terms and the second and
  fourth are to be combined by addition or subtraction, leaves much to be
  desired. Omitting this row, however, the remaining numbers, those which
  are multiples of 2,920, admit of an easy explanation.</p>

  <p>In the first place, the opening term 2,920, which serves as the unit
  of increase for the entire series up to and including the 13th term, is
  the so-called Venus-Solar period, containing 8 Solar years of 365 days
  each and 5 Venus years of 584 days each. This important period is the
  subject of extended treatment elsewhere in the Dresden Codex (pp. 46-50),
  in which it is repeated 39 times in all, divided into three equal
  divisions of 13 periods each. The 13th term of our series 37,960 is, as
  we have seen, 13 × 2,920, the exact number of <!-- Page 278 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span>days treated of in the
  upper divisions of pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex. The 14th term
  (75,920) is the exact number of days treated of in the first two
  divisions, and finally, the 15th, or next to the last term (113,880), is
  the exact number of days treated of in all three divisions of these
  pages.</p>

  <p>This 13th term (37,960) is the first in which the tonalamatl of 260
  days comes into harmony with the Venus and Solar years, and as such must
  have been of very great importance to the Maya. At the same time it
  represents two Calendar Rounds, another important chronological count.
  With the next to the last term (113,880) the Mars year of 780 days is
  brought into harmony with all the other periods named. This number, as
  just mentioned, represents the sum of all the 39 Venus-Solar periods on
  pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex. This next to the last number seems to
  possess more remarkable properties than the last number (151,840), in
  which the Mars year is not contained without a remainder, and the reason
  for its record does not appear.</p>

  <p>The next to the last term contains:</p>

  <p>It will be noted in plate <a href="#plate31">31</a> that the concealed
  starting point of this series is the day <b>1 Ahau</b>, and that just to
  the left on the same plate are two dates, <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b> and <b>1
  Ahau 18 Uo</b>, both of which show this same day, and one of which, <b>1
  Ahau 18 Kayab</b>, is accompanied by its corresponding Initial Series
  9.9.9.16.0. It seems not unlikely, therefore, that the day <b>1 Ahau</b>
  with which this series commences was <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>, which in
  turn was 9.9.9.16.0 <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b> of the Long Count. This is
  rendered somewhat probable by the fact that the second division of 13
  Venus-Solar periods on pages 46-50 of the Dresden Codex also has the same
  date, <b>1 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>, as its terminal date. Hence, it is not
  improbable (more it would be unwise to say) that the series of numbers
  which we have been discussing was counted from the date 9.9.9.16.0. <b>1
  Ahau 18 Kayab</b>.</p>

  <p>The foregoing examples cover, in a general way, the material presented
  in the codices; there is, however, much other matter which has not been
  explained here, as unfitted to the needs of the beginner. To the student
  who wishes to specialize in this field of the glyphic writing the writer
  recommends the treatises of Prof. Ernst Förstemann as the most valuable
  contribution to this subject.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">NOTES</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> All things considered, the Maya
  may be regarded as having developed probably the highest aboriginal
  civilization in the Western Hemisphere, although it should be borne in
  mind that they were surpassed in many lines of endeavor by other races.
  The Inca, for example, excelled them in the arts of weaving and dyeing,
  the Chiriqui in metal working, and the Aztec in military proficiency.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> The correlation of Maya and
  Christian chronology herein followed is that suggested by the writer in
  "The Correlation of Maya and Christian Chronology" (<i>Papers of the
  School of American Archæology</i>, No. 11). See Morley, 1910 b, cited in
  <span class="sc">Bibliography</span>, pp. <span class="sm">XV,
  XVI</span>. There are at least six other systems of correlation, however,
  on which the student must pass judgment. Although no two of these agree,
  all are based on data derived from the same source, namely, the Books of
  Chilan Balam (see p. <a href="#page3">3</a>, footnote 1). The differences
  among them are due to the varying interpretations of the material therein
  presented. Some of the systems of correlation which have been proposed,
  besides that of the writer, are:</p>

  <p>1. That of Mr. C. P. Bowditch (1901 a), found in his pamphlet entitled
  "Memoranda on the Maya Calendars used in The Books of Chilan Balam."</p>

  <p>2. That of Prof. Eduard Seler (1902-1908: <span class="sm">I</span>,
  pp. 588-599). See also <i>Bulletin 28</i>, p. 330.</p>

  <p>3. That of Mr. J. T. Goodman (1905).</p>

  <p>4. That of Pio Perez, in Stephen's Incidents of Travel in Yucatan
  (1843: <span class="sm">I</span>, pp. 434-459; <span
  class="sm">II</span>, pp. 465-469) and in Landa, 1864: pp. 366-429.</p>

  <p>As before noted, these correlations differ greatly from one another,
  Professor Seler assigning the most remote dates to the southern cities
  and Mr. Goodman the most recent. The correlations of Mr. Bowditch and the
  writer are within 260 years of each other. Before accepting any one of
  the systems of correlation above mentioned, the student is strongly urged
  to examine with care The Books of Chilan Balam.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> It is probable that at this early
  date Yucatan had not been discovered, or at least not colonized.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> This evidence is presented by The
  Books of Chilan Balam, "which were copied or compiled in Yucatan by
  natives during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, from
  much older manuscripts now lost or destroyed. They are written in the
  Maya language in Latin characters, and treat, in part at least, of the
  history of the country before the Spanish Conquest. Each town seems to
  have had its own book of Chilan Balam, distinguished from others by the
  addition of the name of the place where it was written, as: The Book of
  Chilan Balam of Mani, The Book of Chilan Balam of Tizimia, and so on.
  Although much of the material presented in these manuscripts is
  apparently contradictory and obscure, their importance as original
  historical sources can not be overestimated, since they constitute the
  only native accounts of the early history of the Maya race which have
  survived the vandalism of the Spanish Conquerors. Of the sixteen Books of
  Chilan Balam now extant, only three, those of the towns of Mani, Tizimin,
  and Chumayel, contain historical matter. These have been translated into
  English, and published by Dr. D. G. Brinton [1882 b] under the title of
  "The Maya Chronicles." This translation with a few corrections has been
  freely consulted in the following discussion."&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Morley</span>, 1910 b: p. 193.</p>

  <p>Although The Books of Chilan Balam are in all probability authentic
  sources for the reconstruction of Maya history, they can hardly be
  considered contemporaneous since, as above explained, they emanate from
  post-Conquest times. The most that can be claimed for them in this
  connection is that the documents from which they were copied were
  probably aboriginal, and contemporaneous, or approximately so, with the
  later periods of the history which they record.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> As will appear later, on the
  calendric side the old system of counting time and of recording events
  gave place to a more abbreviated though less accurate chronology. In
  architecture and art also the change of environment made itself felt, and
  in other lines as well the new land cast a strong influence over Maya
  thought and achievement. In his work entitled "A Study of Maya Art, its
  Subject Matter and Historical Development" (1913), to which students are
  referred for further information, Dr. H. J. Spinden has treated this
  subject extensively.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> The confederation of these three
  Maya cities may have served as a model for the three Nahua cities,
  Tenochtitlan, Tezcuco, and Tlacopan, when they entered into a similar
  alliance some four centuries later.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_7" href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> By Nahua is here meant the
  peoples who inhabited the valley of Mexico and adjacent territory at this
  time.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> The Ball Court, a
  characteristically Nahua development.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> One authority (Landa, 1864: p.
  48) says in this connection: "The governor, Cocom&mdash;the ruler of
  Mayapan&mdash;began to covet riches; and for this purpose he treated with
  the people of the garrison, which the kings of Mexico had in Tabasco and
  Xicalango, that he should deliver his city [i.&nbsp;e. Mayapan] to them; and
  thus he brought the Mexican people to Mayapan and he oppressed the poor
  and made many slaves, and the lords would have killed him if they had not
  been afraid of the Mexicans."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> The first appearance of the
  Spaniards in Yucatan was six years earlier (in 1511), when the caravel of
  Valdivia, returning from the Isthmus of Darien to Hispaniola, foundered
  near Jamaica. About 10 survivors in an open boat were driven upon the
  coast of Yucatan near the Island of Cozumel. Here they were made
  prisoners by the Maya and five, including Valdivia himself, were
  sacrificed. The remainder escaped only to die of starvation and hardship,
  with the exception of two, Geronimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero. Both
  of these men had risen to considerable prominence in the country by the
  time Cortez arrived eight years later. Guerrero had married a chief's
  daughter and had himself become a chief. Later Aguilar became an
  interpreter for Cortez. This handful of Spaniards can hardly be called an
  expedition, however.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> Diego de Landa, second bishop
  of Merida, whose remarkable book entitled "Relacion de las Cosas de
  Yucatan" is the chief authority for the facts presented in the following
  discussion of the manners and customs of the Maya, was born in Cifuentes
  de l'Alcarria, Spain, in 1524. At the age of 17 he joined the Franciscan
  order. He came to Yucatan during the decade following the close of the
  Conquest, in 1549, where he was one of the most zealous of the early
  missionaries. In 1573 he was appointed bishop of Merida, which position
  he held until his death in 1579. His priceless <i>Relacion</i>, written
  about 1565, was not printed until three centuries later, when it was
  discovered by the indefatigable Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg in the library
  of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid, and published by him in 1864.
  The <i>Relacion</i> is the standard authority for the customs prevalent
  in Yucatan at the time of the Conquest, and is an invaluable aid to the
  student of Maya archeology. What little we know of the Maya calendar has
  been derived directly from the pages of this book, or by developing the
  material therein presented.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> The excavations of Mr. E. H.
  Thompson at Labna, Yucatan, and of Dr. Merwin at Holmul, Guatemala, have
  confirmed Bishop Landa's statement concerning the disposal of the dead.
  At Labna bodies were found buried beneath the floors of the buildings,
  and at Holmul not only beneath the floors but also lying on them.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> Examples of this type of
  burial have been found at Chichen Itza and Mayapan in Yucatan. At the
  former site Mr. E. H. Thompson found in the center of a large pyramid a
  stone-lined shaft running from the summit into the ground. This was
  filled with burials and funeral objects&mdash;pearls, coral, and jade,
  which from their precious nature indicated the remains of important
  personages. At Mayapan, burials were found in a shaft of similar
  construction and location in one of the pyramids.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> Landa, 1864: p. 137.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> As the result of a trip to the
  Maya field in the winter of 1914, the writer made important discoveries
  in the chronology of Tikal, Naranjo, Piedras Negras, Altar de
  Sacrificios, Quirigua, and Seibal. The occupancy of Tikal and Seibal was
  found to have extended to 10.2.0.0.0; of Piedras Negras to 9.18.5.0.0; of
  Naranjo to 9.19.10.0.0; and of Altar de Sacrificios to 9.14.0.0.0. (This
  new material is not embodied in pl. <a href="#plate2">2</a>.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> As will be explained in
  chapter V, the writer has suggested the name <i>hotun</i> for the 5 tun,
  or 1,800 day, period.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> Succession in the Aztec royal
  house was not determined by primogeniture, though the supreme office, the
  <i>tlahtouani</i>, as well as the other high offices of state, was
  hereditary in one family. On the death of the tlahtouani the electors
  (four in number) seem to have selected his successor from among his
  brothers, or, these failing, from among his nephews. Except as limiting
  the succession to one family, primogeniture does not seem to have
  obtained; for example, Moctezoma (Montezuma) was chosen tlahtouani over
  the heads of several of his older brothers because he was thought to have
  the best qualifications for that exalted office. The situation may be
  summarized by the statement that while the supreme ruler among the Aztec
  had to be of the "blood royal," his selection was determined by personal
  merit rather than by primogeniture.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> There can be no doubt that
  Förstemann has identified the sign for the planet Venus and possibly a
  few others. (See Förstemann, 1906: p. 116.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> Brasseur de Bourbourg, the
  "discoverer" of Landa's manuscript, added several signs of his own
  invention to the original Landa alphabet. See his introduction to the
  Codex Troano published by the French Government. Leon de Rosny published
  an alphabet of 29 letters with numerous variants. Later Dr. F. Le
  Plongeon defined 23 letters with variants and made elaborate
  interpretations of the texts with this "alphabet" as his key. Another
  alphabet was that proposed by Dr. Hilborne T. Cresson, which included
  syllables as well as letters, and with which its originator also essayed
  to read the texts. Scarce worthy of mention are the alphabet and volume
  of interlinear translations from both the inscriptions and the codices
  published by F. A. de la Rochefoucauld. This is very fantastic and
  utterly without value unless, as Doctor Brinton says, it be taken "as a
  warning against the intellectual aberrations to which students of these
  ancient mysteries seem peculiarly prone." The late Dr. Cyrus Thomas, of
  the Bureau of American Ethnology, was the last of those who endeavored to
  interpret the Maya texts by means of alphabets; though he was perhaps the
  best of them all, much of his work in this particular respect will not
  stand.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> Thus the whole rebus in figure
  <a href="#fig14">14</a> reads: "Eye bee leaf ant rose can well bear awl
  four ewe." These words may be replaced by their homophones as follows: "I
  believe Aunt Rose can well bear all for you."</p>

  <p>Rebus writing depends on the principle of homophones; that is, words
  or characters which sound alike but have different meanings.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> The period of the synodical
  revolution of Venus as computed to-day is 583.920 days.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> According to modern
  calculations, the period of the lunar revolution is 29.530588, or
  approximately 29½ days. For 405 revolutions the accumulated error would
  be .03×405=12.15 days. This error the Maya obviated by using 29.5 in some
  calculations and 29.6 in others, the latter offsetting the former. Thus
  the first 17 revolutions of the sequence are divided into three groups;
  the first 6 revolutions being computed at 29.5, each giving a total of
  177 days; and the second 6 revolutions also being computed at 29.5 each,
  giving a total of another 177 days. The third group of 5 revolutions,
  however, was computed at 29.6 each, giving a total of 148 days. The total
  number of days in the first 17 revolutions was thus computed to be
  177+177+147=502, which is very close to the time computed by modern
  calculations, 502.02.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_23" href="#NtA_23">[23]</a> This is the tropical year or
  the time from one equinox to its return.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_24" href="#NtA_24">[24]</a> Landa, 1864: p. 52.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25" href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> Cogolludo, 1688: <span
  class="sm">I</span>, lib. <span class="sm">IV</span>, <span
  class="sm">V</span>, p. 186.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> For example, if the revolution
  of Venus had been the governing phenomenon, each monument would be
  distant from some other by 584 days; if that of Mars, 780 days; if that
  of Mercury, 115 or 116 days, etc. Furthermore, the sequence, once
  commenced, would naturally have been more or less uninterrupted. It is
  hardly necessary to repeat that the intervals which have been found,
  namely, 7200 and 1800, rest on no known astronomical phenomena but are
  the direct result of the Maya vigesimal system of numeration.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_27" href="#NtA_27">[27]</a> It is possible that the Codex
  Peresianus may treat of historical matter, as already explained.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> Since the sequence of the
  twenty day names was continuous, it is obvious that it had no beginning
  or ending, like the rim of a wheel; consequently any day name may be
  chosen arbitrarily as the starting point. In the accompanying example<img
  src="images/glyph42.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:5.07ex;" alt="" title=""
  /> <b>Kan</b> has been chosen to begin with, though Bishop Landa (p. 236)
  states with regard to the Maya: "The character or letter with which they
  commence their count of the days or calendar is called <b>Hun-ymix</b>
  [i.&nbsp;e. <b>1 Imix</b>]". Again, "Here commences the count of the calendar
  of the Indians, saying in their language <b>Hun Imix</b> (*) [i.&nbsp;e. <b>1
  Imix</b>]." (Ibid., p. 246.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> Professor Seler says the Maya
  of Guatemala called this period the <i>kin katun</i>, or "order of the
  days." He fails to give his authority for this statement, however, and,
  as will appear later, these terms have entirely different meanings. (See
  <i>Bulletin 28</i>, p. 14.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30" href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> As Bishop Landa wrote not
  later than 1579, this is Old Style. The corresponding day in the
  Gregorian Calendar would be July 27.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> This is probably to be
  accounted for by the fact that in the Maya system of chronology, as we
  shall see later, the 365-day year was not used in recording time. But
  that so fundamental a period had therefore no special glyph does not
  necessarily follow, and the writer believes the sign for the haab will
  yet be discovered.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_32" href="#NtA_32">[32]</a> Later researches of the writer
  (1914) have convinced him that figure <a href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>c</i>,
  is not a sign for <b>Uo</b>, but a very unusual variant of the sign for
  <b>Zip</b>, found only at Copan, and there only on monuments belonging to
  the final period.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_33" href="#NtA_33">[33]</a> The writer was able to prove
  during his last trip to the Maya field that figure <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <i>f</i>, is not a sign for the month <b>Zotz</b>,
  as suggested by Mr. Bowditch, but a very unusual form representing
  <b>Kankin</b>. This identification is supported by a number of examples
  at Piedras Negras.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_34" href="#NtA_34">[34]</a> The meanings of these words in
  Nahuatl, the language spoken by the Aztec, are "year bundle" and "our
  years will be bound," respectively. These doubtless refer to the fact
  that at the expiration of this period the Aztec calendar had made one
  complete round; that is, the years were bound up and commenced anew.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> <i>Bulletin 28</i>, p.
  330.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_36" href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> All Initial Series now known,
  with the exception of two, have the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> as their
  common point of departure. The two exceptions, the Initial Series on the
  east side of Stela C at Quirigua and the one on the tablet in the Temple
  of the Cross at Palenque, proceed from the date <b>4 Ahau 8
  Zotz</b>&mdash;more than 5,000 years in advance of the starting point
  just named. The writer has no suggestions to offer in explanation of
  these two dates other than that he believes they refer to some
  mythological event. For instance, in the belief of the Maya the gods may
  have been born on the day <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>, and 5,000 years later
  approximately on <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> the world, including mankind, may
  have been created.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_37" href="#NtA_37">[37]</a> Some writers have called the
  date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, the normal date, probably because it is the
  standard date from which practically all Maya calculations proceed. The
  writer has not followed this practice, however.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_38" href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> That is, dates which signified
  present time when they were recorded.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_39" href="#NtA_39">[39]</a> This statement does not take
  account of the Tuxtla Statuette and the Holactun Initial Series, which
  extend the range of the dated monuments to ten centuries.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> For the discussion of the
  number of cycles in a great cycle, a question concerning which there are
  two different opinions, see pp. <a href="#page107">107</a> et seq.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_41" href="#NtA_41">[41]</a> There are only two known
  exceptions to this statement, namely, the Initial Series on the Temple of
  the Cross at Palenque and that on the east side of Stela C at Quirigua,
  already noted.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_42" href="#NtA_42">[42]</a> Mr. Bowditch (1910: App. VIII,
  310-18) discusses the possible meanings of this element.</p>

  "full-figure glyphs," see p. <a href="#page67">67</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_44" href="#NtA_44">[44]</a> See the discussion of Serpent
  numbers in Chapter VI.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> These three inscriptions are
  found on Stela N, west side, at Copan, the tablet of the Temple of the
  Inscriptions at Palenque, and Stela 10 at Tikal. For the discussion of
  these inscriptions, see pp. <a href="#page114">114</a>-<a
  href="#page127">127</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_46" href="#NtA_46">[46]</a> The discussion of glyphs which
  may represent the great cycle or period of the 6th order will be
  presented on pp. <a href="#page114">114</a>-<a href="#page127">127</a> in
  connection with the discussion of numbers having six or more orders of
  units.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_47" href="#NtA_47">[47]</a> The figure on Zoömorph B at
  Quirigua, however, has a normal human head without grotesque
  characteristics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_48" href="#NtA_48">[48]</a> The full-figure glyphs are
  included with the head variants in this proportion.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_49" href="#NtA_49">[49]</a> Any system of counting time
  which describes a date in such a manner that it can not recur, satisfying
  all the necessary conditions, for 374,400 years, must be regarded as
  absolutely accurate in so far as the range of human life on this planet
  is concerned.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_50" href="#NtA_50">[50]</a> There are a very few monuments
  which have two Initial Series instead of one. So far as the writer knows,
  only six monuments in the entire Maya area present this feature, namely,
  Stelæ F, D, E, and A at Quirigua, Stela 17 at Tikal, and Stela 11 at
  Yaxchilan.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_51" href="#NtA_51">[51]</a> Refer to p. <a
  href="#page64">64</a> and figure <a href="#fig23">23</a>. It will be
  noted that the third tooth (i.&nbsp;e. day) after the one named <b>7 Akbal 11
  Cumhu</b> is <b>10 Cimi 14 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_52" href="#NtA_52">[52]</a> This method of dating does not
  seem to have been used with either uinal or kin period endings, probably
  because of the comparative frequency with which any given date might
  occur at the end of either of these two periods.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_53" href="#NtA_53">[53]</a> In Chapter IV it will be shown
  that two bars stand for the number 10. It will be necessary to anticipate
  the discussion of Maya numerals there presented to the extent of stating
  that a bar represented 5 and a dot or ball, 1. The varying combinations
  of these two elements gave the values up to 20.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_54" href="#NtA_54">[54]</a> The u kahlay katunob on which
  the historical summary given in Chapter I is based shows an absolutely
  uninterrupted sequence of katuns for more than 1,100 years. See Brinton
  (1882 b: pp. 152-164). It is necessary to note here a correction on p.
  153 of that work. Doctor Brinton has omitted a Katun <b>8 Ahau</b> from
  this u kahlay katunob, which is present in the Berendt copy, and he has
  incorrectly assigned the abandonment of Chichen Itza to the preceding
  katun, Katun <b>10 Ahau</b>, whereas the Berendt copy shows this event
  took place during the katun omitted, Katun <b>8 Ahau</b>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_55" href="#NtA_55">[55]</a> There are, of course, a few
  exceptions to this rule&mdash;that is, there are some monuments which
  indicate an interval of more than 3,000 years between the extreme dates.
  In such cases, however, this interval is not divided into katuns, nor in
  fact into any regularly recurring smaller unit, with the single exception
  mentioned in footnote 1, p. <a href="#page84">84</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_56" href="#NtA_56">[56]</a> On one monument, the tablet
  from the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, there seems to be
  recorded a kind of u kahlay katunob; at least, there is a sequence of ten
  consecutive katuns.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_57" href="#NtA_57">[57]</a> The word "numeral," as used
  here, has been restricted to the first twenty numbers, 0 to 19,
  inclusive.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_58" href="#NtA_58">[58]</a> See p. <a
  href="#page96">96</a>, footnote 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_59" href="#NtA_59">[59]</a> In one case, on the west side
  of Stela E at Quirigua, the number 14 is also shown with an ornamental
  element (*<img src="images/glyph88g.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:8.36ex;" alt="" title=""
  />). This is very unusual and, so far as the writer knows, is the only
  example of its kind. The four dots in the numbers 4, 9, 14, and 19 never
  appear thus separated in any other text known.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_60" href="#NtA_60">[60]</a> In the examples given the
  numerical coefficients are attached as prefixes to the katun sign.
  Frequently, however, they occur as superfixes. In such cases, however,
  the above observations apply equally well.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_61" href="#NtA_61">[61]</a> Care should be taken to
  distinguish the number or figure <a href="#fig20">20</a> from any period
  which contained 20 periods of the order next below it; otherwise the
  uinal, katun, and cycle glyphs could all be construed as signs for 20,
  since each of these periods contains 20 units of the period next
  lower.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_62" href="#NtA_62">[62]</a> The Maya numbered by relative
  position from bottom to top, as will be presently explained.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_63" href="#NtA_63">[63]</a> This form of zero is always
  red and is used with black bar and dot numerals as well as with red in
  the codices.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_64" href="#NtA_64">[64]</a> It is interesting to note in
  this connection that the Zapotec made use of the same outline in graphic
  representations of the tonalamatl. On page 1 of the Zapotec Codex
  Féjerváry-Mayer an outline formed by the 260 days of the tonalamatl
  exactly like the one in fig. <a href="#fig48">48</a>, <i>a</i>, is
  shown.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_65" href="#NtA_65">[65]</a> This form of zero has been
  found only in the Dresden Codex. Its absence from the other two codices
  is doubtless due to the fact that the month glyphs are recorded only a
  very few times in them&mdash;but once in the Codex Tro-Cortesiano and
  three times in the Codex Peresianus.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_66" href="#NtA_66">[66]</a> The forms shown attached to
  these numerals are those of the day and month signs (see figs. <a
  href="#fig16">16</a>, <a href="#fig17">17</a>, and <a
  href="#fig19">19</a>, <a href="#fig20">20</a>, respectively), and of the
  period glyphs (see figs. <a href="#fig25">25</a>-<a href="#fig35">35</a>,
  inclusive). Reference to these figures will explain the English
  translation in the case of any form which the student may not
  remember.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_67" href="#NtA_67">[67]</a> The following possible
  exceptions, however, should be noted: In the Codex Peresianus the normal
  form of the tun sign sometimes occurs attached to varying heads, as
  (*<img src="images/glyph96a.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:6.86ex;" alt="" title=""
  />). Whether these heads denote numerals is unknown, but the construction
  of this glyph in such cases (a head attached to the sign of a time
  period) absolutely parallels the use of head-variant numerals with
  time-period glyphs in the inscriptions. A much stronger example of the
  possible use of head numerals with period glyphs in the codices, however,
  is found in the Dresden Codex. Here the accompanying head (&dagger;<img
  src="images/glyph96b.jpg" class="inleft glleft" style="height:7.43ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) is almost surely that for the number 16, the hatchet eye denoting 6
  and the fleshless lower jaw 10. Compare (&dagger;) with fig. <a
  href="#fig53">53</a>, <i>f-i</i>, where the head for 16 is shown. The
  glyph (&Dagger;<img src="images/glyph96c.jpg" class="inright glright" style="height:7.71ex;" alt="" title=""
  />) here shown is the normal form for the kin sign. Compare fig. <a
  href="#fig34">34</a>, <i>b</i>. The meaning of these two forms would thus
  seem to be 16 kins. In the passage in which these glyphs occur the glyph
  next preceding the head for 16 is "8 tuns," the numerical coefficient 8
  being expressed by one bar and three dots. It seems reasonably clear
  here, therefore, that the form in question is a head numeral. However,
  these cases are so very rare and the context where they occur is so
  little understood, that they have been excluded in the general
  consideration of head-variant numerals presented above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_68" href="#NtA_68">[68]</a> It will appear presently that
  the number 13 could be expressed in two different ways: (1) by a special
  head meaning 13, and (2) by the essential characteristic of the head for
  10 applied to the head for 3 (i.&nbsp;e., 10 + 3 = 13).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_69" href="#NtA_69">[69]</a> For the discussion of Initial
  Series in cycles other than Cycle 9, see pp. <a
  href="#page194">194</a>-<a href="#page207">207</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_70" href="#NtA_70">[70]</a> The subfixial element in the
  first three forms of fig. <a href="#fig54">54</a> does not seem to be
  essential, since it is wanting in the last.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_71" href="#NtA_71">[71]</a> As previously explained, the
  number 20 is used only in the codices and there only in connection with
  tonalamatls.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_72" href="#NtA_72">[72]</a> Whether the Maya used their
  numerical system in the inscriptions and codices for counting anything
  besides time is not known. As used in the texts, the numbers occur only
  in connection with calendric matters, at least in so far as they have
  been deciphered. It is true many numbers are found in both the
  inscriptions and codices which are attached to signs of unknown meaning,
  and it is possible that these may have nothing to do with the calendar.
  An enumeration of cities or towns, or of tribute rolls, for example, may
  be recorded in some of these places. Both of these subjects are treated
  of in the Aztec manuscripts and may well be present in Maya texts.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_73" href="#NtA_73">[73]</a> The numerals and periods given
  in fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a> are expressed by their normal forms in
  every case, since these may be more readily recognized than the
  corresponding head variants, and consequently entail less work for the
  student. It should be borne in mind, however, that any bar and dot
  numeral or any period in fig. <a href="#fig56">56</a> could be expressed
  equally well by its corresponding head form without affecting in the
  least the values of the resulting numbers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_74" href="#NtA_74">[74]</a> There may be three other
  numbers in the inscriptions which are considerably higher (see pp. <a
  href="#page114">114</a>-<a href="#page127">127</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_75" href="#NtA_75">[75]</a> These are: (1) The tablet from
  the Temple of the Cross at Palenque; (2) Altar 1 at Piedras Negras; and
  (3) The east side of Stela C at Quirigua.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_76" href="#NtA_76">[76]</a> This case occurs on the tablet
  from the Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_77" href="#NtA_77">[77]</a> It seems probable that the
  number on the north side of Stela C at Copan was not counted from the
  date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>. The writer has not been able to satisfy
  himself, however, that this number is an Initial Series.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_78" href="#NtA_78">[78]</a> Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 41-42)
  notes a seeming exception to this, not in the inscription, however, but
  in the Dresden Codex, in which, in a series of numbers on pp. 71-73, the
  number 390 is written 19 uinals and 10 kins, instead of 1 tun, 1 uinal,
  and 10 kins.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_79" href="#NtA_79">[79]</a> That it was a Cycle 13 is
  shown from the fact that it was just 13 cycles in advance of Cycle 13
  ending on the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_80" href="#NtA_80">[80]</a> See p. <a
  href="#page156">156</a> and fig. <a href="#fig66">66</a> for method of
  designating the individual glyphs in a text.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_81" href="#NtA_81">[81]</a> The kins are missing from this
  number (see A9, fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>). At the maximum, however,
  they could increase this large number only by 19. They have been used
  here as at 0.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_82" href="#NtA_82">[82]</a> As will be explained
  presently, the kin sign is frequently omitted and its coefficient
  attached to the uinal glyph. See p. <a href="#page127">127</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_83" href="#NtA_83">[83]</a> Glyph A9 is missing but
  undoubtedly was the kin sign and coefficient.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_84" href="#NtA_84">[84]</a> The lowest period, the kin, is
  missing. See A9, fig. <a href="#fig60">60</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_85" href="#NtA_85">[85]</a> The use of the word
  "generally" seems reasonable here; these three texts come from widely
  separated centers&mdash;Copan in the extreme southeast, Palenque in the
  extreme west, and Tikal in the central part of the area.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_86" href="#NtA_86">[86]</a> A few exceptions to this have
  been noted on pp. <a href="#page127">127</a>, <a
  href="#page128">128</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_87" href="#NtA_87">[87]</a> The Books of Chilan Balam have
  been included here as they are also expressions of the native Maya
  mind.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_88" href="#NtA_88">[88]</a> This excludes, of course, the
  use of the numerals 1 to 13, inclusive, in the day names, and in the
  numeration of the cycles; also the numerals 0 to 19, inclusive, when used
  to denote the positions of the days in the divisions of the year, and the
  position of any period in the division next higher.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_89" href="#NtA_89">[89]</a> Various methods and tables
  have been devised to avoid the necessity of reducing the higher terms of
  Maya numbers to units of the first order. Of the former, that suggested
  by Mr. Bowditch (1910: pp. 302-309) is probably the most serviceable. Of
  the tables Mr. Goodman's Archæic Annual Calendar and Archæic
  Chronological Calendar (1897) are by far the best. By using either of the
  above the necessity of reducing the higher terms to units of the first
  order is obviated. On the other hand, the processes by means of which
  this is achieved in each case are far more complicated and less easy of
  comprehension than those of the method followed in this book, a method
  which from its simplicity might be termed perhaps the logical way, since
  it reduces all quantities to a primary unit, which is the same as the
  primary unit of the Maya calendar. This method was first devised by Prof.
  Ernst Förstemann, and has the advantage of being the most readily
  understood by the beginner, sufficient reason for its use in this
  book.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_90" href="#NtA_90">[90]</a> This number is formed on the
  basis of 20 cycles to a great cycle (20×144,000=2,880,000). The writer
  assumes that he has established the fact that 20 cycles were required to
  make 1 great cycle, in the inscriptions as well as in the codices.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_91" href="#NtA_91">[91]</a> This is true in spite of the
  fact that in the codices the starting points frequently appear to
  follow&mdash;that is, they stand below&mdash;the numbers which are
  counted from them. In reality such cases are perfectly regular and
  conform to this rule, because there the order is not from top to bottom
  but from bottom to top, and, therefore, when read in this direction the
  dates come first.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_92" href="#NtA_92">[92]</a> These intervening glyphs the
  writer believes, as stated in Chapter II, are those which tell the real
  story of the inscriptions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_93" href="#NtA_93">[93]</a> Only two exceptions to this
  rule have been noted throughout the Maya territory: (1) The Initial
  Series on the east side of Stela C at Quirigua, and (2) the tablet from
  the Temple of the Cross at Palenque. It has been explained that both of
  these Initial Series are counted from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Zotz</b>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_94" href="#NtA_94">[94]</a> In the inscriptions an Initial
  Series may always be identified by the so-called introducing glyph (see
  fig. <a href="#fig24">24</a>) which invariably precedes it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_95" href="#NtA_95">[95]</a> Professor Förstemann has
  pointed out a few cases in the Dresden Codex in which, although the count
  is backward, the special character indicating the fact is wanting (fig.
  <a href="#fig64">64</a>). (See <i>Bulletin</i> 28, p. 401.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_96" href="#NtA_96">[96]</a> There are a few cases in which
  the "backward sign" includes also the numeral in the second position.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_97" href="#NtA_97">[97]</a> In the text wherein this
  number is found the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Camhu</b> stands below the lowest
  term.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_98" href="#NtA_98">[98]</a> It should be noted here that
  in the <i>u kahlay katunob</i> also, from the Books of Chilan Balam, the
  count is always forward.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_99" href="#NtA_99">[99]</a> For transcribing the Maya
  numerical notation into the characters of our own Arabic notation Maya
  students have adopted the practice of writing the various terms from left
  to right in a <i>descending</i> series, as the units of our decimal
  system are written. For example, 4 katuns, 8 tuns, 3 uinals, and 1 kin
  are written 4.8.3.1; and 9 cycles, 16 katuns, 1 tun, 0 uinal, and 0 kins
  are written 9.16.1.0.0. According to this method, the highest term in
  each number is written on the left, the next lower on its right, the next
  lower on the right of that, and so on down through the units of the
  first, or lowest, order. This notation is very convenient for
  transcribing the Maya numbers and will be followed hereafter.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_100" href="#NtA_100">[100]</a> The reason for rejecting
  all parts of the quotient except the numerator of the fractional part is
  that this part alone shows the actual number of units which have to be
  counted either forward or backward, as the count may be, in order to
  reach the number which exactly uses up or finishes the dividend&mdash;the
  last unit of the number which has to be counted.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_101" href="#NtA_101">[101]</a> The student can prove this
  point for himself by turning to the tonalamatl wheel in pl. <a
  href="#plate5">5</a>; after selecting any particular day, as <b>1 Ik</b>
  for example, proceed to count 260 days from this day as a starting point,
  in either direction around the wheel. No matter in which direction he has
  counted, whether beginning with <b>13 Imix</b> or <b>2 Akbal</b>, the
  260th day will be <b>1 Ik</b> again.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_102" href="#NtA_102">[102]</a> The student may prove this
  for himself by reducing 9.0.0.0.0 to days (1,296,000), and counting
  forward this number from the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b>, as described in
  the rules on pages <a href="#page138">138</a>-<a href="#page143">143</a>.
  The terminal date reached will be <b>8 Ahau 13 Ceh</b>, as given
  above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_103" href="#NtA_103">[103]</a> Numbers may also be added
  to or subtracted from Period-ending dates, since the positions of such
  dates are also fixed in the Long Count, and consequently may be used as
  bases of reference for dates whose positions in the Long Count are not
  recorded.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_104" href="#NtA_104">[104]</a> In adding two Maya numbers,
  for example 9.12.2.0.16 and 12.9.5, care should be taken first to arrange
  like units under like, as:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 2.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 0.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">16</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 5</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025">9.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">12.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">14.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">10.</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 1</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Next, beginning at the right, the kins or units of the 1st place are
  added together, and after all the 20s (here 1) have been deducted from
  this sum, place the remainder (here 1) in the kin place. Next add the
  uinals, or units of the 2d place, adding to them 1 for each 20 which was
  carried forward from the 1st place. After all the 18s possible have been
  deducted from this sum (here 0) place the remainder (here 10) in the
  uinal place. Next add the tuns, or units of the 3d place, adding to them
  1 for each 18 which was carried forward from the 2d place, and after
  deducting all the 20s possible (here 0) place the remainder (here 14) in

  <p><a name="Nt_105" href="#NtA_105">[105]</a> The Supplementary Series
  present perhaps the most promising field for future study and
  investigation in the Maya texts. They clearly have to do with a numerical
  count of some kind, which of itself should greatly facilitate progress in
  their interpretation. Mr. Goodman (1897: p. 118) has suggested that in
  some way the Supplementary Series record the dates of the Initial Series
  they accompany according to some other and unknown method, though he
  offers no proof in support of this hypothesis. Mr. Bowditch (1910: p.
  244) believes they probably relate to time, because the glyphs of which
  they are composed have numbers attached to them. He has suggested the
  name Supplementary Series by which they are known, implying in the
  designation that these Series in some way supplement or complete the
  meaning of the Initial Series with which they are so closely connected.
  The writer believes that they treat of some lunar count. It seems almost
  certain that the moon glyph occurs repeatedly in the Supplementary Series
  (see fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_106" href="#NtA_106">[106]</a> The word "closing" as used
  here means only that in reading from left to right and from top to
  bottom&mdash;that is, in the normal order&mdash;the sign shown in fig. <a
  href="#fig65">65</a> is always the last one in the Supplementary Series,
  usually standing immediately before the month glyph of the Initial-series
  terminal date. It does not signify, however, that the Supplementary
  Series were to be read in this direction, and, indeed, there are strong
  indications that they followed the reverse order, from right to left and
  bottom to top.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_107" href="#NtA_107">[107]</a> In a few cases the sign
  shown in fig. <a href="#fig65">65</a> occurs elsewhere in the
  Supplementary Series than as its "closing" glyph. In such cases its
  coefficient is not restricted to the number 9 or 10.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_108" href="#NtA_108">[108]</a> In the codices frequently
  the month parts of dates are omitted and starting points and terminal
  dates alike are expressed as days only; thus, <b>2 Ahau, 5 Imix, 7
  Kan,</b> etc. This is nearly always the case in tonalamatls and in
  certain series of numbers in the Dresden Codex.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_109" href="#NtA_109">[109]</a> Only a very few month signs
  seem to be recorded in the Codex Tro-Cortesiano and the Codex Peresianus.
  The Tro-Cortesiano has only one (p. 73b), in which the date <b>13 Ahau 13
  Cumhu</b> is recorded thus (*<img src="images/glyph153a-c.jpg"
  class="inright glright" style="height:13.21ex;" alt="" title="" />).
  Compare the month form in this date with fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>,
  <i>z-b'</i>. Mr. Gates (1910: p. 21) finds three month signs in the Codex
  Peresianus, on pp. 4, 7, and 18 at 4c7, 7c2, and 18b4, respectively. The
  first of these is <b>16 Zac</b> (**<img src="images/glyph153d.jpg"
  class="inleft glleft" style="height:6.21ex;" alt="" title="" />). Compare
  this form with fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>o</i>. The second is <b>1
  Yaxkin</b> (&dagger;). Compare this form with fig. <a
  href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>i-j</i>. The third is <b>12 Cumhu</b>
  (&dagger;&dagger;); see fig. <a href="#fig20">20</a>, <i>z-b'</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_110" href="#NtA_110">[110]</a> As used throughout this
  work, the word "inscriptions" is applied only to texts from the
  monuments.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_111" href="#NtA_111">[111]</a> The term glyph-block has
  been used instead of glyph in this connection because in many
  inscriptions several different glyphs are included in one glyph-block. In
  such cases, however, the glyphs within the glyph-block follow precisely
  the same order as the glyph-blocks themselves follow in the pairs of
  columns, that is, from left to right and top to bottom.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_112" href="#NtA_112">[112]</a> Initial Series which have
  all their period glyphs expressed by normal forms are comparatively rare;
  consequently the four examples presented in pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>,
  although they are the best of their kind, leave something to be desired
  in other ways. In pl. <a href="#plate6">6</a>, <i>A</i>, for example, the
  month sign was partially effaced though it is restored in the
  accompanying reproduction; in <i>B</i> of the same plate the closing
  glyph of the Supplementary Series (the month-sign indicator) is wanting,
  although the month sign itself is very clear. Again, in <i>D</i> the
  details of the day glyph and month glyph are partially effaced (restored
  in the reproduction), and in <i>C</i>, although the entire text is very
  clear, the month sign of the terminal date irregularly follows
  immediately the day sign. However, in spite of these slight
  irregularities, it has seemed best to present these particular texts as
  the first examples of Initial Series, because their period glyphs are
  expressed by normal forms exclusively, which, as pointed out above, are
  more easily recognized on account of their greater differentiation than
  the corresponding head variants.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_113" href="#NtA_113">[113]</a> In most of the examples
  presented in this chapter the full inscription is not shown, only that
  part of the text illustrating the particular point in question being
  given. For this reason reference will be made in each case to the
  publication in which the entire inscription has been reproduced. The full

  <p><a name="Nt_114" href="#NtA_114">[114]</a> All glyphs expressed in
  this way are to be understood as inclusive. Thus A1-B2 signifies 4
  glyphs, namely, A1, B1, A2, B2,</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_115" href="#NtA_115">[115]</a> The introducing glyph, so
  far as the writer knows, always stands at the beginning of an
  inscription, or in the second glyph-block, that is, at the top. Hence an
  Initial Series can never precede it.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_116" href="#NtA_116">[116]</a> The Initial Series on Stela
  10 at Tikal is the only exception known. See pp. <a

  <p><a name="Nt_117" href="#NtA_117">[117]</a> As will appear in the
  following examples, nearly all Initial Series have 9 as their cycle
  coefficient.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_118" href="#NtA_118">[118]</a> In the present case
  therefore so far as these calculations are concerned, 3,900 is the
  equivalent of 1,427,400.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_119" href="#NtA_119">[119]</a> It should be remembered in
  this connection, as explained on pp. <a href="#page47">47</a>, <a
  href="#page55">55</a>, that the positions in the divisions of the year
  which the Maya called 3, 8, 13, and 18 correspond in our method of naming
  the positions of the days in the months to the 4th, 9th, 14th, and 19th
  positions, respectively.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_120" href="#NtA_120">[120]</a> As stated in footnote 1, p.
  <a href="#page152">152</a>, the meaning of the Supplementary Series has
  not yet been worked out.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_121" href="#NtA_121">[121]</a> The reasons which have led

  <p><a name="Nt_123" href="#NtA_123">[123]</a> Since nothing but
  Initial-series texts will be presented in the plates and figures
  immediately following, a fact which the student will readily detect by
  the presence of the introducing glyph at the head of each text, it is
  unnecessary to repeat for each new text step 2 (p. <a
  href="#page135">135</a>) and step 3 (p. <a href="#page136">136</a>),
  which explain how to determine the starting point of the count and the
  direction of the count, respectively; and the student may assume that the
  starting point of the several Initial Series hereinafter figured will
  always be the date <b>4 Ahau 8 Cumhu</b> and that the direction of the
  count will always be forward.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_124" href="#NtA_124">[124]</a> As will appear later, in
  connection with the discussion of the Secondary Series, the
  Initial-series date of a monument does not always correspond with the
  ending date of the period whose close the monument marks. In other words,
  the Initial-series date is not always the date contemporaneous with the
  formal dedication of the monument as a time-marker. This point will
  appear much more clearly when the function of Secondary Series has been
  explained.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_126" href="#NtA_126">[126]</a> So far as the writer knows,
  the existence of a period containing 5 tuns has not been suggested
  heretofore. The very general practice of closing inscriptions with the
  end of some particular 5-tun period in the Long Count, as 9.18.5.0.0, or
  9.18.10.0.0, or 9.18.15.0.0, or 9.19.0.0.0, for example, seems to
  indicate that this period was the unit used for measuring time in Maya
  chronological records, at least in the southern cities. Consequently, it
  seems likely that there was a special glyph to express this unit.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_128" href="#NtA_128">[128]</a> The student should note
  that from this point steps 2 (p. <a href="#page139">139</a>) and 3 (p. <a

  p. 162, footnote 3).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_129" href="#NtA_129">[129]</a> In each of the above
  cases&mdash;and, indeed, in all the examples following&mdash;the student
  should perform the various calculations by which the results are reached,
  in order to familiarize himself with the workings of the Maya
  chronological system.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_130" href="#NtA_130">[130]</a> The student may apply a
  check at this point to his identification of the day sign in A4 as being
  that for the day <b>Eb</b>. Since the month coefficient in A7 is surely
  10 (2 bars), it is clear from Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a> that the
  only days which can occupy this position in any division of the year are
  <b>Ik, Manik, Eb</b>, and <b>Caban</b>. Now, by comparing the sign in A4
  with the signs for <b>Ik, Manik</b>, and <b>Caban</b>, <i>c, j</i>, and
  <i>a', b'</i>, respectively, of fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, it is very
  evident that A4 bears no resemblance to any of them; hence, since
  <b>Eb</b> is the only one left which can occupy a position 10, the day
  sign in A4 must be <b>Eb</b>, a fact supported by the comparison of A4
  with fig. <a href="#fig16">16</a>, <i>s-u</i>, above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_141" href="#NtA_141">[141]</a> An exception to this

  above remark applies only to the large monuments, which, the writer
  believes, were period-markers. Stela 9 is therefore the next to the
  oldest "period stone" yet discovered at Copan. It is more than likely,
  however, that there are several older ones as yet undeciphered.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_143" href="#NtA_143">[143]</a> Although this date is
  considerably older than that on Stela 9 at Copan, its several glyphs
  present none of the marks of antiquity noted in connection with the
  preceding example (pl. <a href="#plate8">8</a>, <i>B</i>). For example,
  the ends of the bars denoting 5 are not square but round, and the
  head-variant period glyphs do not show the same elaborate and ornate
  treatment as in the Copan text. This apparent contradiction permits of an
  easy explanation. Although the Initial Series on the west side of Stela C
  at Quirigua undoubtedly refers to an earlier date than the Initial Series
  on the Copan monument, it does not follow that the Quirigua monument is
  the older of the two. This is true because on the other side of this same
  stela at Quirigua is recorded another date, 9.17.5.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13
  Kayab</b>, more than three hundred years later than the Initial Series
  9.1.0.0.0 6 <b>Ahau 13 Yaxkin</b> on the west side, and this later date
  is doubtless the one which referred to present time when this monument
  was erected. Therefore the Initial Series 9.1.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13
  Yaxkin</b> does not represent the period which Stela C was erected to
  mark, but some far earlier date in Maya history.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_148" href="#NtA_148">[148]</a> As used throughout this
  book, the expression "the contemporaneous date" designates the time when
  the monument on which such a date is found was put into formal use, that
  is, the time of its erection. As will appear later in the discussion of
  the Secondary Series, many monuments present several dates between the
  extremes of which elapse long periods. Obviously, only one of the dates
  thus recorded can represent the time at which the monument was erected.
  In such inscriptions the final date is almost invariably the one
  designating contemporaneous time, and the earlier dates refer probably to
  historical, traditional, or even mythological events in the Maya past.
  Thus the Initial Series 9.0.19.2.4 <b>2 Kan 2 Yax</b> on Lintel 21 at
  Yaxchilan, 9.1.0.0.0 <b>6 Ahau 13 Yazkin</b> on the west side of Stela C
  at Quirigua, and 9.4.0.0.0 <b>13 Ahau 18 Yax</b> from the Temple of the
  Inscriptions at Palenque, all refer probably to earlier historical or
  traditional events in the past of these three cities, but they do not
  indicate the dates at which they were severally recorded. As Initial
  Series which refer to purely mythological events may be classed the
  Initial Series from the Temples of the Sun, Cross, and Foliated Cross at
  Palenque, and from the east side of Stela C at Quirigua, all of which are
  concerned with dates centering around or at the beginning of Maya
  chronology. Stela 3 at Tikal (the text here under discussion), on the
  other hand, has but one date, which probably refers to the time of its
  erection, and is therefore contemporaneous.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_149" href="#NtA_149">[149]</a> There are one or two
  earlier Initial Series which probably record contemporaneous dates; these
  are not inscribed on large stone monuments but on smaller antiquities,
  namely, the Tuxtla Statuette and the Leyden Plate. For the discussion of
  these early contemporaneous Initial Series, see pp. <a

  in connection with this glyph that the pair of comblike appendages
  usually found are here replaced by a pair of fishes. As explained on pp.
  <a href="#page65">65</a>-<a href="#page66">66</a>, the fish represents
  probably the original form from which the comblike element was derived in
  the process of glyph conventionalization. The full original form of this
  element is therefore in keeping with the other full-figure forms in this
  text.</p>

  Fruit Co., found a still earlier monument about half a mile west of the

  some 30 years earlier than either of the Initial Series here under
  discussion, a significant period just at this particular epoch of Maya
  history, which we have every reason to believe was filled with stirring
  events and quickly shifting scenes. Tikal, with the Initial Series
  10.2.0.0.0 <b>3 Ahau 3 Ceh</b>, and Seibal with the same date (not as an
  Initial Series, however) are the nearest, though even these fall 10 years

  <p><a name="Nt_174" href="#NtA_174">[174]</a> Up to the present time no
  successful interpretation of the inscription on Stela C at Copan has been
  advanced. The inscription on each side of this monument is headed by an
  introducing glyph, but in neither case is this followed by an Initial
  Series. A number consisting of 11.14.5.1.0 is recorded in connection with
  the date <b>6 Ahau 18 Kayab</b>, but as this date does not appear to be
  fixed in the Long Count, there is no way of ascertaining whether it is
  earlier or later than the starting point of Maya chronology. Mr. Bowditch
  (1910: pp. 195-196) offers an interesting explanation of this monument,
  to which the student is referred for the possible explanation of this
  text. A personal inspection of this inscription failed to confirm,
  however, the assumption on which Mr. Bowditch's conclusions rest. For the

  12, not 13, tuns are recorded in A5. As explained elsewhere (see pp. <a
  href="#page247">247</a>, 2<a href="#page48">48</a>), this is an error on
  the part of the ancient scribe who engraved this inscription. The correct
  tun coefficient is 13, as used above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_226" href="#NtA_226">[226]</a> This Secondary-series
  number is doubly irregular. In the first place, the kin and uinal
  coefficients are reversed, the latter standing to the left of its sign

  although it is 14, has an ornamental dot between the two middle dots.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_227" href="#NtA_227">[227]</a> Since we counted
  <i>backward</i> 1.14.6 from <b>6 Cimi 4 Tzec</b> to reach <b>10 Ahau 8

  Chen</b>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_228" href="#NtA_228">[228]</a> It is obvious that the kin
  and uinal coefficients are reversed in A17b since the coefficient above
  the uinal sign is very clearly 19, an impossible value for the uinal
  coefficient in the inscriptions, 19 uinals <i>always</i> being written 1
  tun, 1 uinal. Therefore the 19 must be the kin coefficient. See also p.

  <p><a name="Nt_237" href="#NtA_237">[237]</a> For a seeming exception to
  this statement, in the codices, see p. <a href="#page110">110</a>,
  footnote 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_238" href="#NtA_238">[238]</a> That is, the age of one
  compared with the age of another, without reference to their actual age
  as expressed in terms of our own chronology.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_239" href="#NtA_239">[239]</a> See Chapter II for the
  discussion of this point and the quotations from contemporary
  authorities, both Spanish and native, on which the above statement is
  based.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_240" href="#NtA_240">[240]</a> As explained on p. <a
  href="#page31">31</a>, tonalamatls were probably used by the priests in
  making prophecies or divinations. This, however, is a matter apart from
  their composition, that is, length, divisions, dates, and method of
  counting, which more particularly concerns us here.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_241" href="#NtA_241">[241]</a> The codices are folded like
  a screen or fan, and when opened form a continuous strip sometimes
  several yards in length. As will appear later, in many cases one
  tonalamatl runs across several pages of the manuscript.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_242" href="#NtA_242">[242]</a> If there should be two or
  more columns of day signs the topmost sign of the left-hand column is to
  be read first.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_243" href="#NtA_243">[243]</a> In the original this last
  red dot has disappeared. The writer has inserted it here to avoid
  confusing the beginner in his first acquaintance with a tonalamatl.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_244" href="#NtA_244">[244]</a> This and similar outlines
  which follow are to be read down in columns.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_245" href="#NtA_245">[245]</a> The fifth sign in the lower
  row is also a sign of the Death God (see fig. <a href="#fig3">3</a>).
  Note the eyelashes, suggesting the closed eyes of the dead.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_246" href="#NtA_246">[246]</a> The last sign <b>Chuen</b>,
  as mentioned above, is only a repetition of the first sign, indicating
  that the tonalamatl has re-entered itself.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_247" href="#NtA_247">[247]</a> As previously stated, the
  order of reading the glyphs in columns is from left to right and top to
  bottom.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_248" href="#NtA_248">[248]</a> The right-hand dot of the
  13 is effaced.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_249" href="#NtA_249">[249]</a> The manuscript has
  incorrectly 7.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_250" href="#NtA_250">[250]</a> In the title of plate <a
  href="#plate30">30</a> the page number should read 102 instead of
  113.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_251" href="#NtA_251">[251]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  has 24.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_252" href="#NtA_252">[252]</a> Incorrectly recorded as 13
  in the text.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_253" href="#NtA_253">[253]</a> Incorrectly recorded as 15
  in the text.</p>

  Ethn.</i>, p. 400.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_255" href="#NtA_255">[255]</a> The terminal dates reached
  have been omitted, since for comparative work the Initial-series numbers
  alone are sufficient to show the relative positions in the Long
  Count.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_256" href="#NtA_256">[256]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 10.13.3.13.2; that is, reversing the position of the tun and uinal
  coefficients.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_257" href="#NtA_257">[257]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 10.8.3.16.4. The katun coefficient is changed to 13, above. These
  corrections are all suggested by Professor Förstemann and are necessary
  if the calculations he suggests are correct, as seems probable.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_258" href="#NtA_258">[258]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 8.16.4.11.0. The uinal coefficient is changed to an 8, above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_259" href="#NtA_259">[259]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 10.19.6.0.8. The uinal coefficient is changed to 1, above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_260" href="#NtA_260">[260]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 9.16.4.10.18. The uinal coefficient is changed to 11, above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_261" href="#NtA_261">[261]</a> The manuscript incorrectly
  reads 9.19.8.7.8. The tun coefficient is changed to 5, above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_262" href="#NtA_262">[262]</a> Bowditch, 1909: p. 279.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_263" href="#NtA_263">[263]</a> The manuscript has
  incorrectly <b>16 Uo</b>. It is obvious this can not be correct, since
  from Table <a href="#tableVII">VII</a> <b>Kan</b> can occupy only the 2d,
  7th, 12th, or 17th position in the months. The correct reading here, as
  we shall see, is probably <b>17 Uo</b>. This reading requires only the
  addition of a single dot.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_264" href="#NtA_264">[264]</a> In the text the coefficient
  appears to be 8, but in reality it is 9, the lower dot having been
  covered by the marginal line at the bottom.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_265" href="#NtA_265">[265]</a> Counting backward 8.2.0
  (2,920) from <b>9 Ahau, 1 Ahau</b> is reached.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_266" href="#NtA_266">[266]</a> Professor Förstemann
  restored the top terms of the four numbers in this row, so as to make
  them read as given above.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_267" href="#NtA_267">[267]</a> The manuscript reads
  1.12.5.0, which Professor Förstemann corrects to 1.12.8.0; in other
  words, changing the uinal from 5 to 8. This correction is fully justified
  in the above calculations.</p>
